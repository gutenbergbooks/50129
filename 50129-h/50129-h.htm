      OME, Sam, tell us a story,&rdquo; said I, as Hariet and I crept to his knees, in
      the glow of the bright evening firelight; while Aunt Lois was busily
      rattling the tea-things, and grandmamma, at the other end of the
      fireplace, was quietly setting the heel of a blue-mixed yarn stocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days we had no magazines and daily papers, each reeling off a
      serial story. Once a week, &ldquo;The Columbian Sentinel&rdquo; came from Boston with
      its slender stock of news and editorial; but all the multiform devices&mdash;pictorial,
      narrative, and poetical&mdash;which keep the mind of the present
      generation ablaze with excitement, had not then even an existence. There
      was no theatre, no opera; there were in Oldtown no parties or balls,
      except, perhaps, the annual election, or Thanksgiving festival; and when
      winter came, and the sun went down at half-past four o'clock, and left the
      long, dark hours of evening to be provided for, the necessity of amusement
      became urgent. Hence, in those days, chimney-corner story-telling became
      an art and an accomplishment. Society then was full of traditions and
      narratives which had all the uncertain glow and shifting mystery of the
      firelit hearth upon them. They were told to sympathetic audiences, by the
      rising and falling light of the solemn embers, with the hearth-crickets
      filling up every pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0002" id="linkimage-0002"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

      <a href="images/0015.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then the aged told their stories to the young,&mdash;tales of early life;
      tales of war and adventure, of forest-days, of Indian captivities and
      escapes, of bears and wild-cats and panthers, of rattlesnakes, of witches
      and wizards, and strange and wonderful dreams and appearances and
      providences.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days of early Massachusetts, faith and credence were in the very
      air. Two-thirds of New England was then dark, unbroken forests, through
      whose tangled paths the mysterious winter wind groaned and shrieked and
      howled with weird noises and unaccountable clamors. Along the iron-bound
      shore, the stormful Atlantic raved and thundered, and dashed its moaning
      waters, as if to deaden and deafen any voice that might tell of the
      settled life of the old civilized world, and shut us forever into the
      wilderness. A good story-teller, in those days, was always sure of a warm
      seat at the hearthstone, and the delighted homage of children; and in all
      Oldtown there was no better story-teller than Sam Lawson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, do, tell us a story,&rdquo; said Harry, pressing upon him, and opening very
      wide blue eyes, in which undoubting faith shone as in a mirror; &ldquo;and let
      it be something strange, and different from common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I know lots o' strange things,&rdquo; said Sam, looking mysteriously into
      the fire. &ldquo;Why, I know things, that ef I should tell,&mdash;why, people
      might say they wa'n't so; but then they <i>is so</i> for all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i>, do, tell us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I should scare ye to death, mebbe,&rdquo; said Sam doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pooh! no, you wouldn't,&rdquo; we both burst out at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sam was possessed by a reticent spirit, and loved dearly to be wooed
      and importuned; and so he only took up the great kitchen-tongs, and smote
      on the hickory forestick, when it flew apart in the middle, and scattered
      a shower of clear bright coals all over the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy on us, Sam Lawson!&rdquo; said Aunt Lois in an indignant voice, spinning
      round from her dishwashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you worry a grain, Miss Lois,&rdquo; said Sam composedly. &ldquo;I see that are
      stick was e'en a'most in two, and I thought I'd jest settle it. I 'll
      sweep up the coals now,&rdquo; he added, vigorously applying a turkey-wing to
      the purpose, as he knelt on the hearth, his spare, lean figure glowing in
      the blaze of the firelight, and getting quite flashed with exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now!&rdquo; he said, when he had brushed over and under and between the
      fire-irons, and pursued the retreating ashes so far into the red, fiery
      citadel, that his finger-ends were burning and tingling, &ldquo;that 'are's done
      now as well as Hepsy herself could 'a' done it. I allers sweeps up the
      haarth: I think it's part o' the man's bisness when he makes the fire. But
      Hepsy's so used to seein' me a-doin' on't, that she don't see no kind o'
      merit in't. It's just as Parson Lothrop said in his sermon,&mdash;folks
      allers overlook their common marcies&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But come, Sam, that story,&rdquo; said Harry and I coaxingly, pressing upon
      him, and pulling him down into his seat in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy, these'ere young uns!&rdquo; said Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's never no contentin' on 'em: ye tell 'em one story, and they jest
      swallows it as a dog does a gob o' meat; and they're all ready for
      another. What do ye want to hear now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, the fact was, that Sam's stories had been told us so often, that they
      were all arranged and ticketed in our minds. We knew every word in them,
      and could set him right if he varied a hair from the usual track; and
      still the interest in them was unabated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still we shivered, and clung to his knee, at the mysterious parts, and
      felt gentle, cold chills run down our spines at appropriate places. We
      were always in the most receptive and sympathetic condition. To-night, in
      particular, was one of those thundering stormy ones, when the winds
      appeared to be holding a perfect mad carnival over my grandfather's house.
      They yelled and squealed round the corners; they collected in troops, and
      came tumbling and roaring down chimney; they shook and rattled the
      buttery-door and the sinkroom-door and the cellar-door and the
      chamber-door, with a constant undertone of squeak and clatter, as if at
      every door were a cold, discontented spirit, tired of the chill outside,
      and longing for the warmth and comfort within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, boys,&rdquo; said Sam confidentially, &ldquo;what 'll ye have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us 'Come down, come down!'&rdquo; we both shouted with one voice. This
      was, in our mind, an &ldquo;A No. 1&rdquo; among Sam's stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye mus'n't be frightened now,&rdquo; said Sam paternally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! we ar'n't frightened <i>ever</i>,&rdquo; said we both in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when ye go down the cellar arter cider?&rdquo; said Sam with severe
      scrutiny. &ldquo;Ef ye should be down cellar, and the candle should go out,
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;I ain't afraid of any thing. I never knew what it was
      to be afraid in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, then,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I 'll tell ye. This'ere's what Cap'n Eb Sawin told
      me when I was a boy about your bigness, I reckon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap'n Eb Sawin was a most respectable man. Your gran'ther knew him very
      well; and he was a deacon in the church in Dedham afore he died. He was at
      Lexington when the fust gun was fired agin the British. He was a dreffle
      smart man, Cap'n Eb was, and driv team a good many years atween here and
      Boston. He married Lois Peabody, that was cousin to your gran'ther then.
      Lois was a rael sensible woman; and I've heard her tell the story as he
      told her, and it was jest as he told it to me,&mdash;jest exactly; and I
      shall never forget it if I live to be nine hundred years old, like
      Mathuselah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, along back in them times, there used to be a fellow come round
      these'ere parts, spring and fall, a-peddlin' goods, with his pack on his
      back; and his name was Jehiel Lommedieu. Nobody rightly knew where he come
      from. He wasn't much of a talker; but the women rather liked him, and kind
      o' liked to have him round. Women will like some fellows, when men can't
      see no sort o' reason why they should; and they liked this'ere Lommedieu,
      though he was kind o' mournful and thin and shad-bellied, and hadn't
      nothin' to say for himself. But it got to be so, that the women would
      count and calculate so many weeks afore 'twas time for Lommedieu to be
      along; and they'd make up ginger-snaps and preserves and pies, and make
      him stay to tea at the houses, and feed him up on the best there was: and
      the story went round, that he was a-courtin' Phebe Ann Parker, or Phebe
      Ann was a-courtin' him,&mdash;folks didn't rightly know which. Wal, all of
      a sudden, Lommedieu stopped comin' round; and nobody knew why,&mdash;only
      jest he didn't come. It turned out that Phebe Ann Parker had got a letter
      from him, sayin' he'd be along afore Thanksgiving; but he didn't come,
      neither afore nor at Thanksgiving time, nor arter, nor next spring: and
      finally the women they gin up lookin' for him. Some said he was dead; some
      said he was gone to Canada; and some said he hed gone over to the Old
      Country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, as to Phebe Ann, she acted like a gal o' sense, and married 'Bijah
      Moss, and thought no more 'bout it. She took the right view on't, and said
      she was sartin that all things was ordered out for the best; and it was
      jest as well folks couldn't always have their own way. And so, in time,
      Lommedieu was gone out o' folks's minds, much as a last year's
      apple-blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's relly affectin' to think how little these'ere folks is missed that's
      so much sot by. There ain't nobody, ef they's ever so important, but what
      the world gets to goin' on without 'em, pretty much as it did with 'em,
      though there's some little flurry at fust. Wal, the last thing that was in
      anybody's mind was, that they ever should hear from Lommedieu agin. But
      there ain't nothin' but what has its time o' turnin' up; and it seems his
      turn was to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, 'twas the 19th o' March, when Cap'n Eb Sawin started with a
      team for Boston. That day, there come on about the biggest snow-storm that
      there'd been in them parts sence the oldest man could remember.'Twas
      this'ere fine, siftin' snow, that drives in your face like needles, with a
      wind to cut your nose off: it made teamin' pretty tedious work. Cap'n Eb
      was about the toughest man in them parts. He'd spent days in the woods
      a-loggin', and he'd been up to the deestrict o' Maine a-lumberin', and was
      about up to any sort o' thing a man gen'ally could be up to; but these'ere
      March winds sometimes does set on a fellow so, that neither natur' nor
      grace can stan' 'em. The cap'n used to say, he could stan' any wind that
      blew one way 't time for five minutes; but come to winds that blew all
      four p'ints at the same minit,&mdash;why, they flustered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, that was the sort o' weather it was all day: and by sundown Cap'n Eb
      he got clean bewildered, so that he lost his road; and, when night came
      on, he didn't know nothin' where he was. Ye see the country was all under
      drift, and the air so thick with snow, that he couldn't see a foot afore
      him; and the fact was, he got off the Boston road without knowin' it, and
      came out at a pair o' bars nigh upon Sherburn, where old Cack Sparrock's
      mill is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your gran'ther used to know old Cack, boys. He was a drefful drinkin' old
      crittur, that lived there all alone in the woods by himself a-tendin' saw
      and grist mill. He wa'n't allers jest what he was then. Time was that Cack
      was a pretty consid'ably likely young man, and his wife was a very
      respectable woman,&mdash;Deacon Amos Petengall's dater from Sherburn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ye see, the year arter his wife died, Cack he gin up goin' to meetin'
      Sundays, and, all the tithing-men and selectmen could do, they couldn't
      get him out to meetin'; and, when a man neglects means o' grace and
      sanctuary privileges, there ain't no sayin' <i>what</i> he 'll do next.
      Why, boys, jist think on't!&mdash;an immortal crittur lyin' round loose
      all day Sunday, and not puttin' on so much as a clean shirt, when all
      'spectable folks has on their best close, and is to meetin' worshippin'
      the Lord! What can you spect to come of it, when he lies idlin' round in
      his old week-day close, fishing, or some sich, but what the Devil should
      be arter him at last, as he was arter old Cack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Sam winked impressively to my grandfather in the opposite corner, to
      call his attention to the moral which he was interweaving with his
      narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, Cap'n Eb he told me, that when he come to them bars and
      looked up, and saw the dark a-comin' down, and the storm a-thickenin' up,
      he felt that things was gettin' pretty consid'able serious. There was a
      dark piece o' woods on ahead of him inside the bars; and he knew, come to
      get in there, the light would give out clean. So he jest thought he'd take
      the hoss out o' the team, and go ahead a little, and see where he was. So
      he driv his oxen up ag'in the fence, and took out the hoss, and got on
      him, and pushed along through the woods, not rightly knowin' where he was
      goin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, afore long he see a light through the trees; and, sure enough, he
      come out to Cack Sparrock's old mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a pretty consid'able gloomy sort of a place, that are old mill
      was. There was a great fall of water that come rushin' down the rocks, and
      fell in a deep pool; and it sounded sort o' wild and lonesome: but Cap'n
      Eb he knocked on the door with his whip-handle, and got in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, to be sure, sot old Cack beside a great blazin' fire, with his
      rum-jug at his elbow. He was a drefful fellow to drink, Cack was! For all
      that, there was some good in him, for he was pleasant-spoken and 'bliging;
      and he made the cap'n welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ye see, Cack,' said Cap'n Eb, 'I'm off my road, and got snowed up down
      by your bars,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Want ter know!' says Cack. 'Calculate you 'll jest have to camp down
      here till mornin',' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, so old Cack he got out his tin lantern, and went with Cap'n Eb back
      to the bars to help him fetch along his critturs. He told him he could put
      'em under the mill-shed. So they got the critturs up to the shed, and got
      the cart under; and by that time the storm was awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Cack he made a great roarin' fire, 'cause, ye see, Cack allers had
      slab-wood a plenty from his mill; and a roarin' fire is jest so much
      company. It sort o' keeps a fellow's spirits up, a good fire does. So Cack
      he sot on his old teakettle, and made a swingeing lot o' toddy; and he and
      Cap'n Eb were havin' a tol'able comfortable time there. Cack was a pretty
      good hand to tell stories; and Cap'n Eb warn't no way backward in that
      line, and kep' up his end pretty well: and pretty soon they was a-roarin'
      and haw-hawin' inside about as loud as the storm outside; when all of a
      sudden, 'bout midnight, there come a loud rap on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Lordy massy! what's that?' says Cack. Folks is rather startled allers to
      be checked up sudden when they are a-carryin' on and laughin'; and it was
      such an awful blowy night, it was a little scary to have a rap on the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, they waited a minit, and didn't hear nothin' but the wind
      a-screechin' round the chimbley; and old Cack was jest goin' on with his
      story, when the rap come ag'in, harder'n ever, as if it'd shook the door
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says old Cack, 'if 'tis the Devil, we'd jest as good's open, and
      have it out with him to onst,' says he; and so he got up and opened the
      door, and, sure enough, there was old Ketury there. Expect you've heard
      your grandma tell about old Ketury. She used to come to meetin's
      sometimes, and her husband was one o' the prayin' Indians; but Ketury was
      one of the rael wild sort, and you couldn't no more convert <i>her</i>
      than you could convert a wild-cat or a painter [panther]. Lordy massy!
      Ketury used to come to meetin', and sit there on them Indian benches; and
      when the second bell was a-tollin', and when Parson Lothrop and his wife
      was comin' up the broad aisle, and everybody in the house ris' up and
      stood, Ketury would sit there, and look at 'em out o' the corner o' her
      eyes; and folks used to say she rattled them necklaces o' rattlesnakes'
      tails and wild-cat teeth, and sich like heathen trumpery, and looked for
      all the world as if the spirit of the old Sarpent himself was in her. I've
      seen her sit and look at Lady Lothrop out o' the corner o' her eyes; and
      her old brown baggy neck would kind o' twist and work; and her eyes they
      looked so, that 'twas enough to scare a body. For all the world, she
      looked jest as if she was a-workin' up to spring at her. Lady Lothrop was
      jest as kind to Ketury as she always was to every poor crittur. She'd bow
      and smile as gracious to her when meetin' was over, and she come down the
      aisle, passin' out o, meetin'; but Ketury never took no notice. Ye see,
      Ketury's father was one o' them great powwows down to Martha's Vineyard;
      and people used to say she was set apart, when she was a child, to the
      sarvice o' the Devil: any way, she never could be made nothin' of in a
      Christian way. She come down to Parson Lothrop's study once or twice to be
      catechised; but he couldn't get a word out o' her, and she kind o' seemed
      to sit scornful while he was a-talkin'. Folks said, if it was in old
      times, Ketury wouldn't have been allowed to go on so; but Parson Lothrop's
      so sort o' mild, he let her take pretty much her own way. Everybody
      thought that Ketury was a witch: at least, she knew consid'able more'n she
      ought to know, and so they was kind o' 'fraid on her. Cap'n Eb says he
      never see a fellow seem scareder than Cack did when he see Ketury
      a-standin' there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ye see, boys, she was as withered and wrinkled and brown as an old
      frosted punkin-vine; and her little snaky eyes sparkled and snapped, and
      it made yer head kind o' dizzy to look at 'em; and folks used to say that
      anybody that Ketury got mad at was sure to get the worst of it fust or
      last. And so, no matter what day or hour Ketury had a mind to rap at
      anybody's door, folks gen 'lly thought it was best to let her in; but
      then, they never thought her coming was for any good, for she was just
      like the wind,&mdash;she came when the fit was on her, she staid jest so
      long as it pleased her, and went when she got ready, and not before.
      Ketury understood English, and could talk it well enough, but always
      seemed to scorn it, and was allers mowin' and mutterin' to herself in
      Indian, and winkin' and blinkin' as if she saw more folks round than you
      did, so that she wa'n't no way pleasant company; and yet everybody took
      good care to be polite to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So old Cack asked her to come in, and didn't make no question where she
      come from, or what she come on; but he knew it was twelve good miles from
      where she lived to his hut, and the snow was drifted above her middle: and
      Cap'n Eb declared that there wa'n't no track, nor sign o' a track, of
      anybody's coming through that snow next morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did she get there, then?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't ye never see brown leaves a-ridin' on the wind? Well,' Cap'n Eb he
      says, 'she came on the wind,' and I'm sure it was strong enough to fetch
      her. But Cack he got her down into the warm corner, and he poured her out
      a mug o' hot toddy, and give her: but ye see her bein' there sort o'
      stopped the conversation; for she sot there a-rockin' back'ards and
      for'ards, a-sippin her toddy, and a-mutterin', and lookin' up chimbley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap'n Eb says in all his born days he never hearn such screeches and
      yells as the wind give over that chimbley; and old Cack got so frightened,
      you could fairly hear his teeth chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Cap'n Eb he was a putty brave man, and he wa'n't goin' to have
      conversation stopped by no woman, witch or no witch; and so, when he see
      her mutterin', and lookin' up chimbley, he spoke up, and says he, 'Well,
      Ketury, what do you see?' says he. 'Come, out with it; don't keep it to
      yourself.' Ye see Cap'n Eb was a hearty fellow, and then he was a leetle
      warmed up with the toddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he said he see an evil kind o' smile on Ketury's face, and she
      rattled her necklace o' bones and snakes' tails; and her eyes seemed to
      snap; and she looked up the chimbley, and called out, 'Come down, come
      down! let's see who ye be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there was a scratchin' and a rumblin' and a groan; and a pair of
      feet come down the chimbley, and stood right in the middle of the haarth,
      the toes pi'ntin' out'rds, with shoes and silver buckles a-shinin' in the
      firelight. Cap'n Eb says he never come so near bein' scared in his life;
      and, as to old Cack, he jest wilted right down in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then old Ketury got up, and reached her stick up chimbley, and called out
      louder, 'Come down, come down! let's see who ye be.' And, sure enough,
      down came a pair o' legs, and j'ined right on to the feet: good fair legs
      they was, with ribbed stockings and leather breeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, we're in for it now,' says Cap'n Eb. 'Go it, Ketury, and let's have
      the rest on him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ketury didn't seem to mind him: she stood there as stiff as a stake, and
      kep' callin' out, 'Come down, come down! let's see who ye be.' And then
      come down the body of a man with a brown coat and yellow vest, and j'ined
      right on to the legs; but there wa'n't no arms to it. Then Ketury shook
      her stick up chimbley, and called, '<i>Come down, come down!</i>' And
      there came down a pair o' arms, and went on each side o' the body; and
      there stood a man all finished, only there wa'n't no head on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, Ketury,' says Cap'n Eb, 'this 'ere's getting serious. I 'spec' you
      must finish him up, and let's see what he wants of us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Ketury called out once more, louder'n ever, 'Come down, come down!
      let's see who ye be.' And, sure enough, down comes a man's head, and
      settled on the shoulders straight enough; and Cap'n Eb, the minit he sot
      eyes on him, knew he was Jehiel Lommedieu.

    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Cack knew him too; and he fell flat on his face, and prayed the Lord
      to have mercy on his soul: but Cap'n Eb he was for gettin' to the bottom
      of matters, and not have his scare for nothin'; so he says to him, 'What
      do you want, now you hev come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man he didn't speak; he only sort o' moaned, and p'inted to the
      chimbley. He seemed to try to speak, but couldn't; for ye see it isn't
      often that his sort o' folks is permitted to speak: but just then there
      came a screechin' blast o' wind, and blowed the door open, and blowed the
      smoke and fire all out into the room, and there seemed to be a whirlwind
      and darkness and moans and screeches; and, when it all cleared up, Ketury
      and the man was both gone, and only old Cack lay on the ground, rolling
      and moaning as if he'd die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cap'n Eb he picked him up, and built up the fire, and sort o'
      comforted him up, 'cause the crittur was in distress o' mind that was
      drefful. The awful Providence, ye see, had awakened him, and his sin had
      been set home to his soul; and he was under such conviction, that it all
      had to come out,&mdash;how old Cack's father had murdered poor Lommedieu
      for his money, and Cack had been privy to it, and helped his father build
      the body up in that very chimbley; and he said that he hadn't had neither
      peace nor rest since then, and that was what had driv' him away from
      ordinances; for ye know sinnin' will always make a man leave prayin'. Wal,
      Cack didn't live but a day or two. Cap'n Eb he got the minister o'
      Sherburn and one o' the selectmen down to see him; and they took his
      deposition. He seemed railly quite penitent; and Parson Carryl he prayed
      with him, and was faithful in settin' home the providence to his soul: and
      so, at the eleventh hour, poor old Cack might have got in; at least it
      looks a leetle like it. He was distressed to think he couldn't live to be
      hung. He sort o' seemed to think, that if he was fairly tried, and hung,
      it would make it all square. He made Parson Carryl promise to have the old
      mill pulled down, and bury the body; and, after he was dead, they did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cap'n Eb he was one of a party o' eight that pulled down the chimbley;
      and there, sure enough, was the skeleton of poor Lommedieu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there you see, boys, there can't be no iniquity so hid but what it 'll
      come out. The wild Indians of the forest, and the stormy winds and
      tempests, j'ined together to bring out this'ere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Aunt Lois sharply, &ldquo;I never believed that story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Lois,&rdquo; said my grandmother, &ldquo;Cap'n Eb Sawin was a regular
      church-member, and a most respectable man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law, mother! I don't doubt he thought so. I suppose he and Cack got
      drinking toddy together, till he got asleep, and dreamed it. I wouldn't
      believe such a thing if it did happen right before my face and eyes. I
      should only think I was crazy, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Lois, if I was you, I wouldn't talk so like a Sadducee,&rdquo; said my
      grandmother. &ldquo;What would become of all the accounts in Dr. Cotton Mather's
      'Magnilly' if folks were like you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Sam Lawson, drooping contemplatively over the coals, and
      gazing into the fire, &ldquo;there's a putty consid'able sight o' things in this
      world that's true; and then ag'in there's a sight o' things that ain't
      true. Now, my old gran'ther used to say, 'Boys, says he, 'if ye want to
      lead a pleasant and prosperous life, ye must contrive allers to keep jest
      the <i>happy medium</i> between truth and falsehood.' Now, that are's my
      doctrine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Lois knit severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;don't you want ter go down with me and get a mug o'
      cider?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course we did, and took down a basket to bring up some apples to roast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; says Sam mysteriously, while he was drawing the cider, &ldquo;you jest
      ask your Aunt Lois to tell you what she knows 'bout Ruth Sullivan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you must ask <i>her</i>. These 'ere folks that's so kind o' toppin'
      about sperits and sich, come sift 'em down, you gen 'lly find they knows
      one story that kind o' puzzles 'em. Now you mind, and jist ask your Aunt
      Lois about Ruth Sullivan.&rdquo;

    <p>
      UNT LOIS,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what was that story about Ruth Sullivan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Lois's quick black eyes gave a surprised flash; and she and my
      grandmother looked at each other a minute significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you any thing about Ruth Sullivan,&rdquo; she said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody. Somebody said <i>you</i> knew something about her,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was holding a skein of yarn for Aunt Lois; and she went on winding in
      silence, putting the ball through loops and tangled places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little boys shouldn't ask questions,&rdquo; she concluded at last
      sententiously. &ldquo;Little boys that ask too many questions get sent to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew that of old, and rather wondered at my own hardihood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Lois wound on in silence; but, looking in her face, I could see
      plainly that I had started an exciting topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; pursued my grandmother in her corner, &ldquo;that Ruth's case
      might show you, Lois, that a good many things may happen,&mdash;more than
      you believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, mother! Ruth's was a strange case; but I suppose there are ways
      of accounting for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believed Ruth, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly, I believed Ruth! Why shouldn't I? Ruth was one of my best
      friends, and as true a girl as lives: there wasn't any nonsense about
      Ruth. She was one of the sort,&rdquo; said Aunt Lois reflectively, &ldquo;that I'd as
      soon trust as myself: when she said a thing was so and so, I knew it was
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you think Ruth's story was true,&rdquo; pursued my grandmother,
      &ldquo;what's the reason you are always cavilling at things just 'cause you
      can't understand how they came to be so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Lois set her lips firmly, and wound with grim resolve. She was the
      very impersonation of that obstinate rationalism that grew up at the
      New-England fireside, close alongside of the most undoubting faith in the
      supernatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe such things,&rdquo; at last she snapped out, &ldquo;and I don't
      disbelieve them. I just let 'em alone. What do I know about 'em? Ruth
      tells me a story; and I believe her. I know what she saw beforehand, came
      true in a most remarkable way. Well, I'm sure I've no objection. One thing
      may be true, or another, for all me; but, just because I believe Ruth
      Sullivan, I'm not going to believe, right and left, all the stories in
      Cotton Mather, and all that anybody can hawk up to tell. Not I.&rdquo; This
      whole conversation made me all the more curious to get at the story thus
      dimly indicated; and so we beset Sam for information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your Aunt Lois wouldn't tell ye nothin',&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Wanter know,
      neow! sho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: she said we must go to bed if we asked her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That 'are's a way folks has; but, ye see, boys,&rdquo; said Sam, while a droll
      confidential expression crossed the lack-lustre dolefulness of his visage,
      &ldquo;ye see, I put ye up to it, 'cause Miss Lois is so large and commandin' in
      her ways, and so kind o' up and down in all her doin's, that I like once
      and a while to sort o' gravel her; and I knowed enough to know that that
      'are question would git her in a tight place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, yer Aunt Lois was knowin' to all this 'ere about Ruth, so there
      wer'n't no gettin' away from it; and it's about as remarkable a providence
      as any o' them of Mister Cotton Marther's 'Magnilly.' So if you 'll come
      up in the barn-chamber this arternoon, where I've got a lot o' flax to
      hatchel out, I 'll tell ye all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that afternoon beheld Sam arranged at full length on a pile of top-tow
      in the barn-chamber, hatchelling by proxy by putting Harry and myself to
      the service.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, boys, it's kind o' refreshing to see how wal ye take hold,&rdquo; he
      observed. &ldquo;Nothin' like bein' industrious while ye'r young: gret sight
      better now than loafin off, down in them medders.

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sam, if we work for you, you must tell us that story about Ruth
      Sullivan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy! yis,&mdash;course I will. I've had the best kind o' chances
      of knowin' all about that 'are. Wal, you see there was old Gineral
      Sullivan, he lived in state and grande'r in the old Sullivan house out to
      Roxberry. I been to Roxberry, and seen that 'are house o' Gineral
      Sullivan's. There was one time that I was a consid'able spell lookin'
      round in Roxberry, a kind o' seein' how things wuz there, and whether or
      no there mightn't be some sort o' providential openin' or suthin'. I used
      to stay with Aunt Polly Ginger. She was sister to Mehitable Ginger,
      Gineral Sullivan's housekeeper, and hed the in and out o' the Sullivan
      house, and kind o' kept the run o' how things went and came in it. Polly
      she was a kind o' cousin o' my mother's, and allers glad to see me. Fact
      was, I was putty handy round house; and she used to save up her broken
      things and sich till I come round in the fall; and then I'd mend 'em up,
      and put the clock right, and split her up a lot o' kindlings, and board up
      the cellar-windows, and kind o' make her sort o' comfortable,&mdash;she
      bein' a lone body, and no man round. As I said, it was sort o' convenient
      to hev me; and so I jest got the run o' things in the Sullivan house
      pretty much as ef I was one on 'em. Gineral Sullivan he kept a grand
      house, I tell you. You see, he cum from the old country, and felt sort o'
      lordly and grand; and they used to hev the gretest kind o' doin's there to
      the Sullivan house. Ye ought ter a seen that 'are house,&mdash;gret big
      front hall and gret wide stairs; none o' your steep kind that breaks a
      feller's neck to get up and down, but gret broad stairs with easy risers,
      so they used to say you could a cantered a pony up that 'are stairway easy
      as not. Then there was gret wide rooms, and sofys, and curtains, and gret
      curtained bedsteads that looked sort o' like fortifications, and pictur's
      that was got in Italy and Rome and all them 'are heathen places. Ye see,
      the Gineral was a drefful worldly old critter, and was all for the pomps
      and the vanities. Lordy massy! I wonder what the poor old critter thinks
      about it all now, when his body's all gone to dust and ashes in the
      graveyard, and his soul's gone to 'tarnity! Wal, that are ain't none o' my
      business; only it shows the vanity o' riches in a kind o' strikin' light,
      and makes me content that I never hed none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sam, I hope General Sullivan wasn't a wicked man, <i>was</i> he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I wouldn't say he was railly wickeder than the run; but he was one
      o' these 'ere high-stepping, big-feeling fellers, that seem to be a hevin'
      their portion in this life. Drefful proud he was; and he was pretty much
      sot on this world, and kep' a sort o' court goin' on round him. Wal, I
      don't jedge him nor nobody: folks that hes the world is apt to get sot on
      it. Don't none on us do more than middlin' well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sam, what about Ruth Sullivan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth?&mdash;Oh, yis!&mdash;Ruth&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, the only crook in the old Gineral's lot was he didn't hev no
      children. Mis' Sullivan, she was a beautiful woman, as handsome as a
      pictur'; but she never had but one child; and he was a son who died when
      he was a baby, and about broke her heart. And then this 'ere Ruth was her
      sister's child, that was born about the same time; and, when the boy died,
      they took Ruth home to sort o' fill his place, and kind o' comfort up Mis'
      Sullivan. And then Ruth's father and mother died; and they adopted her for
      their own, and brought her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, she grew up to be amazin' handsome. Why, everybody said that she was
      jest the light and glory of that 'are old Sullivan place, and worth more'n
      all the pictur's and the silver and the jewels, and all there was in the
      house; and she was jest so innercent and sweet, that you never see nothing
      to beat it. Wal, your Aunt Lois she got acquainted with Ruth one summer
      when she was up to Old Town a visitin' at Parson Lothrop's. Your Aunt Lois
      was a gal then, and a pretty good-lookin' one too; and, somehow or other,
      she took to Ruth, and Ruth took to her. And when Ruth went home, they used
      to be a writin' backwards and forads; and I guess the fact was, Ruth
      thought about as much of your Aunt Lois as she did o' anybody. Ye see,
      your aunt was a kind o' strong up-and-down woman that always knew certain
      jest what she did know; and Ruth, she was one o' them gals that seems sort
      o' like a stray lamb or a dove that's sort o' lost their way in the world,
      and wants some one to show 'em where to go next. For, ye see, the fact
      was, the old Gineral and Madam, they didn't agree very well. He wa'n't
      well pleased that she didn't have no children; and she was sort o' jealous
      o' him 'cause she got hold o' some sort of story about how he was to a
      married somebody else over there in England: so she got sort o' riled up,
      jest as wimmen will, the best on 'em; and they was pretty apt to have
      spats, and one could give t'other as good as they sent; and, by all
      accounts, they fit putty lively sometimes. And, between the two, Ruth she
      was sort o' scared, and fluttered like a dove that didn't know jest where
      to settle. Ye see, there she was in that 'are great wide house, where they
      was a feastin' and a prancin' and a dancin', and a goin' on like
      Ahashuerus and Herodias and all them old Scriptur' days. There was a
      comin' and goin,' and there was gret dinners and gret doin's, but no love;
      and, you know, the Scriptur' says, 'Better is a dinner o' yarbs, where
      love is, than a stalled ox, and hatred therewith.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I don't orter say <i>hatred</i>, arter all. I kind o reckon, the old
      Gineral did the best he could: the fact is, when a woman gits a kink in
      her head agin a man, the best on us don't allers do jest the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any way, Ruth, she was sort o' forlorn, and didn't seem to take no
      comfort in the goin's on. The Gineral he was mighty fond on her, and proud
      on her; and there wa'n't nothin' too good for Ruth. He was free-handed,
      the Gineral wuz. He dressed her up in silks and satins, and she hed a maid
      to wait on her, and she hed sets o' pearl and dimond; and Madam Sullivan
      she thought all the world on her, and kind o' worshipped the ground she
      trod on. And yet Ruth was sort o' lonesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, Ruth wa'n't calculated for grande'r. Some folks ain't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that 'are summer she spent out to Old Town, she was jest as chirk
      and chipper as a wren, a wearin' her little sun-bunnet, and goin' a
      huckle-berryin' and a black-berryin' and diggin' sweet-flag, and gettin
      cowslops and dandelions; and she hed a word for everybody. And everybody
      liked Ruth, and wished her well. Wal, she was sent for her health; and she
      got that, and more too: she got a sweetheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, there was a Cap'n Oliver a visitin' at the minister's that
      summer,&mdash;a nice, handsome young man as ever was. He and Ruth and your
      Aunt Lois, they was together a good deal; and they was a ramblin' and a
      ridin' and a sailin': and so Ruth and the Capting went the way o' all the
      airth, and fell dead in love with each other. Your Aunt Lois she was
      knowing to it and all about it, 'cause Ruth she was jest one of them that
      couldn't take a step without somebody to talk to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Oliver was of a good family in England; and so, when he made bold
      to ask the old Gineral for Ruth, he didn't say him nay: and it was agreed,
      as they was young, they should wait a year or two. If he and she was of
      the same mind, he should be free to marry her. Jest right on that, the
      Captain's regiment was ordered home, and he had to go; and, the next they
      heard, it was sent off to India. And poor little Ruth she kind o' drooped
      and pined; but she kept true, and wouldn't have nothin' to say to nobody
      that came arter her, for there was lots and cords o' fellows as did come
      arter her. Ye see, Ruth had a takin' way with her; and then she had the
      name of bein' a great heiress, and that allers draws fellers, as molasses
      does flies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, then the news came, that Captain Oliver was comin' home to England,
      and the ship was took by the Algerenes, and he was gone into slavery there
      among them heathen Mahomedans and what not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks seemed to think it was all over with him, and Ruth might jest as
      well give up fust as last. And the old Gineral he'd come to think she
      might do better; and he kep' a introducin' one and another, and tryin' to
      marry her off; but Ruth she wouldn't. She used to write sheets and sheets
      to your Aunt Lois about it; and I think Aunt Lois she kep' her grit up.
      Your Aunt Lois she'd a stuck by a man to the end o' time ef't ben her
      case; and so she told Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, then there was young Jeff Sullivan, the Gineral's nephew, he turned
      up; and the Gineral he took a gret fancy to him. He was next heir to the
      Gineral; but he'd ben a pretty rackety youngster in his young days,&mdash;off
      to sea, and what not, and sowed a consid'able crop o' wild oats. People
      said he'd been a pirating off there in South Ameriky. Lordy massy! nobody
      rightly knew where he hed ben or where he hadn't: all was, he turned up at
      last all alive, and chipper as a skunk blackbird. Wal, of course he made
      his court to Ruth; and the Gineral, he rather backed him up in it; but
      Ruth she wouldn't have nothin' to say to him. Wal, he come and took up his
      lodgin' at the Gineral's; and he was jest as slippery as an eel, and sort
      o' slid into every thing, that was a goin' on in the house and about it.
      He was here, and he was there, and he was everywhere, and a havin' his say
      about this and that; and he got everybody putty much under his thumb. And
      they used to say, he wound the Gineral round and round like a skein o'
      yarn; but he couldn't come it round Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the Gineral said she shouldn't be forced; and Jeff, he was smooth as
      satin, and said he'd be willing to wait as long as Jacob did for Rachel.
      And so there he sot down, a watchin' as patient as a cat at a
      mousehole; 'cause the Gineral he was thick-set and shortnecked, and drank
      pretty free, and was one o' the sort that might pop off any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Mis' Sullivan, she beset the Gineral to make a provision for
      Ruth; 'cause she told him very sensible, that he'd brought her up in
      luxury, and that it wa'n't fair not to settle somethin' on her; and so the
      Gineral he said he'd make a will, and part the property equally between
      them. And he says to Jeff, that, if he played his part as a young fellow
      oughter know how, it would all come to him in the end; 'cause they hadn't
      heard nothing from Captain Oliver for three or four years, and folks about
      settled it that he must, be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the Gineral he got a letter about an estate that had come to him in
      England; and he had to go over. Wal, livin' on the next estate, was the
      very cousin of the Gineral's that he was to a married when they was both
      young: the lands joined so that the grounds run together. What came
      between them two nobody knows; but she never married, and there she was.
      There was high words between the Gineral and Madam Sullivan about his
      goin' over. She said there wa'n't no sort o' need on't, and he said there
      was; and she said she hoped <i>she</i> should be in her grave afore he
      come back; and he said she might suit herself about that for all him. That
      'are was the story that the housekeeper told to Aunt Polly; and Aunt Polly
      she told me. These 'ere squabbles somehow allers does kind o' leak out one
      way or t'other. Anyhow, it was a house divided agin itself at the
      Gineral's, when he was a fixin' out for the voyage. There was Ruth a goin'
      fust to one, and then to t'other, and tryin' all she could to keep peace
      beteen 'em; and there was this 'ere Master Slick Tongue talkin' this way
      to one side, and that way to t'other, and the old Gineral kind o' like a
      shuttle-cock atween 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, then, the night afore he sailed, the Gineral he hed his lawyer up in
      his library there, a lookin' over all his papers and bonds and things, and
      a witnessing his will; and Master Jeff was there, as lively as a cricket,
      a goin' into all affairs, and offerin' to take precious good care while he
      was gone; and the Gineral he had his papers and letters out, a sortin' on
      'em over, which was to be took to the old country, and which was to be put
      in a trunk to go back to Lawyer Dennis's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Abner Ginger, Polly's boy, he that was footman and waiter then at
      the Gineral's, he told me, that, about eight o'clock that evening he went
      up with hot water and lemons and sperits and sich, and he see the gret
      green table in the library all strewed and covered with piles o' papers;
      and there was tin boxes a standin' round; and the Gineral a packin' a
      trunk, and young Master Jeff, as lively and helpful as a rat that smells
      cheese. And then the Gineral he says, 'Abner,' says he, 'can you write
      your name?'&mdash;'I should hope so, Gineral.' says Abner.&mdash;'Wal,
      then, Abner,' says he, 'this is my last will; and I want you to witness
      it,' and so Abner he put down his name opposite to a place with a wafer
      and a seal; and then the Gineral, he says, 'Abner, you tell Ginger to come
      here.' That, you see, was his housekeeper, my Aunt Polly's sister, and a
      likely woman as ever was. And so they had her up, and she put down her
      name to the will; and then Aunt Polly she was had up (she was drinking tea
      there that night), and she put down her name. And all of 'em did it with
      good heart, 'cause it had got about among 'em that the will was to provide
      for Miss Ruth; for everybody loved Ruth, ye see, and there was consid'ble
      many stories kind o' goin' the rounds about Master Jeff and his doin's.
      And they did say he sort o' kep' up the strife atween the Gineral and my
      lady, and so they didn't think none too well o' him; and, as he was next
      o' kin, and Miss Ruth wa'n't none o' the Gineral's blood (ye see, she was
      Mis' Sullivan's sister's child), of course there wouldn't nothin' go to
      Miss Ruth in way o' law, and so that was why the signin' o' that 'are will
      was so much talked about among 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see, the Gineral he sailed the next day; and Jeff he staid by to
      keep watch o' things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the old Gineral he got over safe; for Miss Sullivan, she had a
      letter from him all right. When he got away, his conscience sort o' nagged
      him, and he was minded to be a good husband. At any rate, he wrote a good
      loving letter to her, and sent his love to Ruth, and sent over lots o'
      little keepsakes and things for her, and told her that he left her under
      good protection, and wanted her to try and make up her mind to marry Jeff,
      as that would keep the property together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now there couldn't be no sort o' sugar sweeter than Jeff was to them
      lone wimmen. Jeff was one o' the sort that could be all things to all
      wimmen. He waited and he tended, and he was as humble as any snake in the
      grass that ever ye see and the old lady, she clean fell in with him, but
      Ruth, she seemed to have a regular spite agin him. And she that war as
      gentle as a lamb, that never had so much as a hard thought of a mortal
      critter, and wouldn't tread on a worm, she was so set agin Jeff, that she
      wouldn't so much as touch his hand when she got out o' her kerridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now comes the strange part o' my story: Ruth was one o' the kind
      that <i>hes the gift o' seein'. She was born with a veil over her face!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This mysterious piece of physiological information about Ruth was given
      with a look and air that announced something very profound and awful; and
      we both took up the inquiry, &ldquo;Born with a veil over her face? How should
      <i>that</i> make her see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, boys, how should I know? But the fact <i>is so</i>. There's those as
      is wal known as lies the gift o' seein' what others can't see: they can
      see through walls and houses; they can see people's hearts; they can see
      what's to come. They don't know nothin' how 'tis, but this 'ere knowledge
      comes to 'em: it's a gret gift; and that sort's born with the veil over
      their faces. Ruth was o' these 'ere. Old Granny Badger she was the
      knowingest old nuss in all these parts; and she was with Ruth's mother
      when she was born, and she told Lady Lothrop all about it. Says she, 'You
      may depend upon it that child 'll have the &ldquo;<i>second-sight</i>,&rdquo;' says
      she. Oh, that 'are fact was wal known! Wal, that was the reason why Jeff
      Sullivan couldn't come it round Ruth tho' he was silkier than a
      milkweed-pod, and jest about as patient as a spider in his hole a watchin'
      to got his grip on a fly. Ruth wouldn't argue with him, and she wouldn't
      flout him; but she jest shut herself up in herself, and kept a lookout on
      him; but she told your Aunt Lois jest what she thought about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, in about six months, come the news that the Gineral was dead. He
      dropped right down in his tracks, dead with apoplexy, as if he had been
      shot; and Lady Maxwell she writ a long letter to my lady and Ruth. Ye see,
      he'd got to be Sir Thomas Sullivan over there; and he was a comin' home to
      take 'em all over to England to live in grande'r. Wal, my Lady Sullivan
      (she was then, ye see) she took it drefful hard. Ef they'd a been the
      lovingest couple in the world, she couldn't a took it harder. Aunt Polly,
      she said it was all 'cause she thought so much of him, that she fit him
      so. There's women that thinks so much o' their husbands, that they won't
      let 'em hev no peace o' their life; and I expect it war so with her poor
      soul! Any way, she went right down smack when she heard he was dead. She
      was abed, sick, when the news come; and she never spoke nor smiled, jest
      turned her back to everybody, and kinder wilted and wilted, and was dead
      in a week. And there was poor little Ruth left all alone in the world,
      with neither kith nor kin but Jeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, when the funeral was over, and the time app'inted to read the will
      and settle up matters, there wa'n't no will to be found nowhere, high nor
      low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawyer Dean he flew round like a parched pea on a shovel. He said he
      thought he could a gone in the darkest night, and put his hand on that
      'ere will; but when he went where he thought it was, he found it warn't
      there, and he knowed he'd kep' it under lock and key. What he thought was
      the will turned out to be an old mortgage. Wal, there was an awful row and
      a to-do about it, you may be sure. Ruth, she jist said nothin' good or
      bad. And her not speakin' made Jeff a sight more uncomfortable than ef
      she'd a hed it out with him. He told her it shouldn't make no sort o'
      difference; that he should allers stand ready to give her all he hed, if
      she'd only take him with it. And when it came to that she only gin him a
      look, and went out o' the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeff he flared and flounced and talked, and went round and round a
      rumpussin' among the papers, but no will was forthcoming high or low. Wal,
      now here comes what's remarkable. Ruth she told this 'ere, all the
      particulars, to yer Aunt Lois and Lady Lothrop. She said that the night
      after the funeral she went up to her chamber. Ruth had the gret front
      chamber, opposite to Mis' Sullivan's. I've been in it; it was a monstrous
      big room, with outlandish furniture in it, that the Gineral brought over
      from an old palace out to Italy. And there was a great big lookin'-glass
      over the dressin'-table, that they said come from Venice, that swung so
      that you could see the whole room in it. Wal, she was a standin' front o'
      this, jist goin' to undress herself, a hearin' the rain drip on the leaves
      and the wind a whishin' and whisperin' in the old elm-trees, and jist a
      thinkin' over her lot, and what should she do now, all alone in the world,
      when of a sudden she felt a kind o' lightness in her head, and she thought
      she seemed to see somebody in the glass a movin'. And she looked behind,
      and there wa'n't nobody there. Then she looked forward in the glass, and
      saw a strange big room, that she'd never seen before, with a long painted
      winder in it; and along side o' this stood a tall cabinet with a good many
      drawers in it. And she saw herself, and knew that it was herself, in this
      room, along with another woman whose back was turned towards her. She saw
      herself speak to this woman, and p'int to the cabinet. She saw the woman
      nod her head. She saw herself go to the cabinet, and open the middle
      drawer, and take out a bundle o' papers from the very back end on't. She
      saw her take out a paper from the middle, and open it, and hold it up; and
      she knew that there was the missin' will. Wal, it all overcome her so that
      she fainted clean away. And her maid found her a lyin' front o' the
      dressin'-table on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was sick of a fever for a week or fortnight a'ter; and your Aunt Lois
      she was down takin' care of her; and, as soon as she got able to be moved,
      she was took out to Lady Lothrop's. Jeff he was jist as attentive and good
      as he could be; but she wouldn't bear him near her room. If he so much as
      set a foot on the stairs that led to it she'd know it, and got so wild
      that he hed to be kept from comin' into the front o' the house. But he was
      doin' his best to buy up good words from everybody. He paid all the
      servants double; he kept every one in their places, and did so well by 'em
      all that the gen'l word among 'em was that Miss Ruth couldn't do better
      than to marry such a nice, open-handed gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Lady Lothrop she wrote to Lady Maxwell all that hed happened; and
      Lady Maxwell, she sent over for Ruth to come over and be a companion for
      her, and said she'd adopt her, and be as a mother to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, then Ruth she went over with some gentlefolks that was goin' back to
      England, and offered to see her safe and sound; and so she was set down at
      Lady Maxwell's manor. It was a grand place, she said, and such as she
      never see before,&mdash;like them old gentry places in England. And Lady
      Maxwell she made much of her, and cosseted her up for the sake of what the
      old Gineral had said about her. And Ruth she told her all her story, and
      how she believed that the will was to be found somewhere, and that she
      should be led to see it yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told her, too, that she felt it in her that Cap'n Oliver wasn't dead,
      and that he'd come back yet. And Lady Maxwell she took up for her with
      might and main, and said she'd stand by her. But then, ye see, so long as
      there warn't no will to be found, there warn't nothin' to be done. Jeff
      was the next heir; and he'd got every thing, stock, and lot, and the
      estate in England into the bargain. And folks was beginnin' to think putty
      well of him, as folks allers does when a body is up in the world, and hes
      houses and lands. Lordy massy! riches allers covers a multitude o' sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, when Ruth hed ben six months with her, one day Lady Maxwell got
      to tellin' her all about her history, and what hed ben atween her and her
      cousin, when they was young, and how they hed a quarrel and he flung off
      to Ameriky, and all them things that it don't do folks no good to remember
      when it's all over and can't be helped. But she was a lone body, and it
      seemed to do her good to talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, she says to Ruth, says she, 'I 'll show you a room in this house
      you han't seen before. It was the room where we hed that quarrel,' says
      she; 'and the last I saw of him was there, till he come back to die,' says
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she took a gret key out of her bunch; and she led Ruth along a long
      passage-way to the other end of the house, and opened on a great library.
      And the minute Ruth came in, she threw up her hands and gin a great cry.
      'Oh!' says she, 'this is the room! and there is the window! and there is
      the cabinet I and <i>there in that middle drawer at the back end in a
      bundle of papers is the will!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Lady Maxwell she said, quite dazed, 'Go look,' says she. And Ruth
      went, jest as she seed herself do, and opened the drawer, and drew forth
      from the back part a yellow pile of old letters. And in the middle of
      those was the will, sure enough. Ruth drew it out, and opened it, and
      showed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see that will give Ruth the whole of the Gineral's property in
      America, tho' it did leave the English estate to Jeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the end on't was like a story-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeff he made believe be mighty glad. And he said it must a ben that the
      Gineral hed got flustered with the sperit and water, and put that 'ere
      will in among his letters that he was a doin' up to take back to England.
      For it was in among Lady Maxwell's letters that she writ him when they was
      young, and that he'd a kep' all these years and was a takin' back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Lawyer Dean said he was sure that Jeff made himself quite busy and
      useful that night, a tyin' up the papers with red tape, and a packin' the
      Gin-eral's trunk; and that, when Jeff gin him his bundle to lock up in his
      box, he never mistrusted but what he'd got it all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see it was jest one of them things that can't be known to the
      jedgment-day. It might a ben an accident, and then agin it might not; and
      folks settled it one way or t'other, 'cordin' to their 'pinion o' Jeff;
      but ye see how 'mazin' handy for him it happened! Why, ef it hadn't ben
      for the providence I've ben a tellin' about, there it might a lain in them
      old letters, that Lady Maxwell said she never hed the heart to look over!
      it never would a turned up in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what became of Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Cap'n Oliver he came back all alive, and escaped from the Algerines;
      and they was married in King's Chapel, and lived in the old Sullivan
      House, in peace and prosperity. That's jest how the story was; and now
      Aunt Lois can make what she's a mind ter out on't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what became of Jeff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he started to go over to England, and the ship was wrecked off the
      Irish coast, and that was the last of him. He never got to his property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough for him,&rdquo; said both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I don't know: 'twas pretty hard on Jeff. Mebbe he did, and mebbe he
      didn't. I'm glad I warn't in his shoes, tho' I'd rather never hed nothin'.
      This 'ere hastin' to be rich is sich a drefful temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, boys, ye've done a nice lot o' flax, and I guess we 'll go up
      to yer grand'ther's cellar and git a mug o' cyder. Talkin' always gits me
      dry.&rdquo;

    <p>
      AL, you see, boys, 'twas just here,&mdash;Parson Carryl's wife, she died
      along in the forepart o' March: my cousin Huldy, she undertook to keep
      house for him. The way on't was, that Huldy, she went to take care o' Mis'
      Carryl in the fust on't, when she fust took sick. Huldy was a tailoress by
      trade; but then she was one o' these 'ere facultised persons that has a
      gift for most any thing, and that was how Mis' Carryl come to set sech
      store by her, that, when she was sick, nothin' would do for her but she
      must have Huldy round all the time: and the minister, he said he'd make it
      good to her all the same, and she shouldn't lose nothin' by it. And so
      Huldy, she staid with Mis' Carryl full three months afore she died, and
      got to seein' to every thing pretty much round the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, arter Mis' Carryl died, Parson Carryl, he'd got so kind o' used to
      hevin' on her 'round, takin' care o' things, that he wanted her to stay
      along a spell; and so Huldy, she staid along a spell, and poured out his
      tea, and mended his close, and made pies and cakes, and cooked and washed
      and ironed, and kep' every thing as neat as a pin. Huldy was a drefful
      chipper sort o' gal; and work sort o' rolled off from her like water off a
      duck's back. There warn't no gal in Sherburne that could put sich a sight
      o' work through as Huldy; and yet, Sunday mornin', she always come out in
      the singers' seat like one o' these 'ere June roses, lookin' so fresh and
      smilin', and her voice was jest as clear and sweet as a meadow lark's&mdash;Lordy
      massy! I 'member how she used to sing some o' them 'are places where the
      treble and counter used to go together: her voice kind o trembled a
      little, and it sort o' went thro' and thro' a feller! tuck him right where
      he lived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Sam leaned contemplatively back with his head in a clump of sweet
      fern, and refreshed himself with a chew of young wintergreen. &ldquo;This'ere
      young wintergreen, boys, is jest like a feller's thoughts o' things that
      happened when he was young: it comes up jest so fresh and tender every
      year, the longest time you hev to live; and you can't help chawin' on't
      tho' 'tis sort o' stingin'. I don't never get over likin' young
      wintergreen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But about Huldah, Sam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! about Huldy. Lordy massy! when a feller is Indianin' round,
      these 'ere pleasant summer days, a feller's thoughts gits like a flock o'
      young partridges: they's up and down and everywhere; 'cause one place is
      jest about as good as another, when they's all so kind o' comfortable and
      nice. Wal, about Huldy,&mdash;as I was a sayin'. She was jest as handsome
      a gal to look at as a feller could have; and I think a nice, well-behaved
      young gal in the singers' seat of a Sunday is a means o' grace: it's sort
      o' drawin' to the unregenerate, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, boys, in them days, I've walked ten miles over to Sherburne of a
      Sunday mornin', jest to play the bass-viol in the same singers' seat with
      Huldy. She was very much respected, Huldy was; and, when she went out to
      tailorin', she was allers bespoke six months ahead, and sent for in
      waggins up and down for ten miles round; for the young fellers was allers
      'mazin' anxious to be sent after Huldy, and was quite free to offer to go
      for her. Wal, after Mis' Carryl died, Huldy got to be sort o' housekeeper
      at the minister's, and saw to every thing, and did every thing: so that
      there warn't a pin out o' the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know how 'tis in parishes: there allers is women that thinks the
      minister's affairs belongs to them, and they ought to have the rulin' and
      guidin' of 'em; and, if a minister's wife dies, there's folks that allers
      has their eyes open on providences,&mdash;lookin' out who's to be the next
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there was Mis' Amaziah Pipperidge, a widder with snappin' black
      eyes, and a hook nose,&mdash;kind o' like a hawk; and she was one o' them
      up-and-down commandin' sort o' women, that feel that they have a call to
      be seein' to every thing that goes on in the parish, and 'specially to the
      minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks did say that Mis' Pipperidge sort o' sot her eye on the parson for
      herself: wal, now that 'are might a been, or it might not. Some folks
      thought it was a very suitable connection. You see she hed a good property
      of her own, right nigh to the minister's lot, and was allers kind o'
      active and busy; so, takin' one thing with another, I shouldn't wonder if
      Mis' Pipperidge should a thought that Providence p'inted that way. At any
      rate, she went up to Deakin Blodgett's wife, and they two sort o' put
      their heads together a mournin' and condolin' about the way. things was
      likely to go on at the minister's now Mis' Carryl was dead. Ye see, the
      parson's wife, she was one of them women who hed their eyes everywhere and
      on every thing. She was a little thin woman, but tough as Inger rubber,
      and smart as a steel trap; and there warn't a hen laid an egg, or cackled,
      but Mis' Carryl was right there to see about it; and she hed the garden
      made in the spring, and the medders mowed in summer, and the cider made,
      and the corn husked, and the apples got in the fall; and the doctor, he
      hedn't nothin' to do but jest sit stock still a meditatin' on Jerusalem
      and Jericho and them things that ministers think about. But Lordy massy!
      he didn't know nothin' about where any thing he eat or drunk or wore come
      from or went to: his wife jest led him 'round in temporal things and took
      care on him like a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, to be sure, Mis' Carryl looked up to him in spirituals, and thought
      all the world on him; for there warn't a smarter minister no where 'round.
      Why, when he preached on decrees and election, they used to come clear
      over from South Parish, and West Sherburne, and Old Town to hear him; and
      there was sich a row o' waggins tied along by the meetin'-house that the
      stables was all full, and all the hitchin'-posts was full clean up to the
      tavern, so that folks said the doctor made the town look like a gineral
      trainin'-day a Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was gret on texts, the doctor was. When he hed a p'int to prove, he'd
      jest go thro' the Bible, and drive all the texts ahead o' him like a flock
      o' sheep; and then, if there was a text that seemed gin him, why, he'd
      come out with his Greek and Hebrew, and kind o' chase it 'round a spell,
      jest as ye see a fellar chase a contrary bell-wether, and make him jump
      the fence arter the rest. I tell you, there wa'n't no text in the Bible
      that could stand agin the doctor when his blood was up. The year arter the
      doctor was app'inted to preach the 'lection sermon in Boston, he made such
      a figger that the Brattlestreet Church sent a committee right down to see
      if they couldn't get him to Boston; and then the Sherburne folks, they up
      and raised his salary; ye see, there ain't nothin' wakes folks up like
      somebody else's wantin' what you've got. Wal, that fall they made him a
      Doctor o' Divinity at Cambridge College, and so they sot more by him than
      ever. Wal, you see, the doctor, of course he felt kind o' lonesome and
      afflicted when Mis' Carryl was gone; but railly and truly, Huldy was so up
      to every thing about house, that the doctor didn't miss nothin' in a
      temporal way. His shirt-bosoms was pleated finer than they ever was, and
      them ruffles 'round his wrists was kep' like the driven snow; and there
      warn't a brack in his silk stockin's, and his shoe buckles was kep'
      polished up, and his coats brushed; and then there warn't no bread and
      biscuit like Huldy's; and her butter was like solid lumps o' gold; and
      there wern't no pies to equal hers; and so the doctor never felt the loss
      o' Miss Carryl at table. Then there was Huldy allers oppisite to him, with
      her blue eyes and her cheeks like two fresh peaches. She was kind o'
      pleasant to look at; and the more the doctor looked at her the better he
      liked her; and so things seemed to be goin' on quite quiet and comfortable
      ef it hadn't been that Mis' Pipperidge and Mis' Deakin Blodgett and Mis'
      Sawin got their heads together a talkin' about things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Poor man,' says Mis' Pipperidge, 'what can that child that he's got
      there do towards takin' the care of all that place? It takes a mature
      woman,' she says, 'to tread in Mis' Carryl's shoes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That it does,' said Mis' Blodgett; 'and, when things once get to runnin'
      down hill, there ain't no stoppin' on 'em,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Mis' Sawin she took it up. (Ye see, Mis' Sawin used to go out to
      dress-makin', and was sort o' jealous, 'cause folks sot more by Huldy than
      they did by her). 'Well,' says she, 'Huldy Peters is well enough at her
      trade. I never denied that, though I do say I never did believe in her way
      o' makin' button-holes; and I must say, if 'twas the dearest friend I hed,
      that I thought Huldy tryin' to fit Mis' Kittridge's plumb-colored silk was
      a clear piece o' presumption; the silk was jist spiled, so 'twarn't fit to
      come into the meetin'-house. I must say, Huldy's a gal that's always too
      ventersome about takin' 'spon-sibilities she don't know nothin' about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Of course she don't,' said Mis' Deakin Blodgett. 'What does she know
      about all the lookin' and see-in' to that there ought to be in guidin' the
      minister's house. Huldy's well meanin', and she's good at her work, and
      good in the singers' seat; but Lordy massy I she hain't got no experience.
      Parson Carryl ought to have an experienced woman to keep house for him.
      There's the spring house-cleanin' and the fall house-cleanin' to be seen
      to, and the things to be put away from the moths; and then the gettin'
      ready for the association and all the ministers' meetin's; and the makin'
      the soap and the candles, and settin' the hens and turkeys, watchin' the
      calves, and seein' after the 'hired men and the garden; and there that
      'are blessed man jist sets there at home as serene, and has nobody 'round
      but that 'are gal, and don't even know how things must be a runnin' to
      waste!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the upshot on't was, they fussed and fuzzled and wuzzled till they'd
      drinked up all the tea in the teapot; and then they went down and called
      on the parson, and wuzzled him all up talkin' about this, that, and
      t'other that wanted lookin' to, and that it was no way to leave every
      thing to a young chit like Huldy, and that he ought to be lookin' about
      for an experienced woman. The parson he thanked 'em kindly, and said he
      believed their motives was good, but he didn't go no further. He didn't
      ask Mis' Pipperidge to come and stay there and help him, nor nothin' o'
      that kind; but he said he'd attend to matters himself. The fact was, the
      parson had got such a likin' for havin' Huldy 'round, that he couldn't
      think o' such a thing as swappin' her off for the Widder Pipperidge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he thought to himself, 'Huldy is a good girl; but I oughtn't to be a
      leavin' every thing to her,&mdash;it's too hard on her. I ought to be
      instructin' and guidin' and helpin' of her; 'cause 'tain't everybody could
      be expected to know and do what Mis' Carryl did;' and so at it he went;
      and Lordy massy! didn't Huldy hev a time on't when the minister began to
      come out of his study, and want to tew 'round and see to things? Huldy,
      you see, thought all the world of the minister, and she was 'most afraid
      to laugh; but she told me she couldn't, for the life of her, help it when
      his back was turned, for he wuzzled things up in the most singular way.
      But Huldy she'd jest say 'Yes, sir,' and get him off into his study, and
      go on her own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Huldy,' says the minister one day, 'you ain't experienced out doors;
      and, when you want to know any thing, you must come to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, sir,' says Huldy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, Huldy,' says the parson,' you must be sure to save the turkey-eggs,
      so that we can have a lot of turkeys for Thanksgiving.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, sir,' says Huldy; and she opened the pantry-door, and showed him a
      nice dishful she'd been a savin' up. Wal, the very next day the parson's
      hen-turkey was found killed up to old Jim Scroggs's barn. Folks said
      Scroggs killed it; though Scroggs, he stood to it he didn't: at any rate,
      the Scroggses, they made a meal on't; and Huldy, she felt bad about it
      'cause she'd set her heart on raisin' the turkeys; and says she, 'Oh,
      dear! I don't know what I shall do. I was just ready to set her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do, Huldy?' says the parson: 'why, there's the other turkey, out there
      by the door; and a fine bird, too, he is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough, there was the old tom-turkey a struttin' and a sidlin' and a
      quitterin,' and a floutin' his tail-feathers in the sun, like a lively
      young widower, all ready to begin life over agin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But,' says Huldy, 'you know <i>he</i> can't set on eggs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He can't? I'd like to know why,' says the parson. 'He <i>shall</i> set
      on eggs, and hatch 'em too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'O doctor!' says Huldy, all in a tremble; 'cause, you know, she didn't
      want to contradict the minister, and she was afraid she should laugh,&mdash;'I
      never heard that a tom-turkey would set on eggs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, they ought to,' said the parson, getting quite 'arnest: 'what else
      be they good for? you just bring out the eggs, now, and put 'em in the
      nest, and I 'll make him set on 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Huldy she thought there wern't no way to convince him but to let him
      try: so she took the eggs out, and fixed 'em all nice in the nest; and
      then she come back and found old Tom a skirmishin' with the parson pretty
      lively, I tell ye. Ye see, old Tom he didn't take the idee at all; and he
      flopped and gobbled, and fit the parson; and the parson's wig got 'round
      so that his cue stuck straight out over his ear, but he'd got his blood
      up. Ye see, the old doctor was used to carryin' his p'ints o' doctrine;
      and he hadn't fit the Arminians and Socinians to be beat by a tom-turkey;
      so finally he made a dive, and ketched him by the neck in spite o' his
      floppin', and stroked him down, and put Huldy's apron 'round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There, Huldy,' he says, quite red in the face, 'we've got him now;' and
      he travelled off to the barn with him as lively as a cricket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huldy came behind jist chokin' with laugh, and afraid the minister would
      look 'round and see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, Huldy, we 'll crook his legs, and set him down,' says the parson,
      when they got him to the nest: 'you see he is getting quiet, and he 'll
      set there all right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the parson, he sot him down; and old Tom he sot there solemn enough,
      and held his head down all droopin', lookin' like a rail pious old cock,
      as long as the parson sot by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There: you see how still he sets,' says the parson to Huldy.
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Huldy was 'most dyin' for fear she should laugh, 'I'm afraid he 'll get
      up,' says she, 'when you do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, no, he won't!' says the parson, quite confident. 'There, there,'
      says he, layin' his hands on him, as if pronouncin' a blessin'. But when
      the parson riz up, old Tom he riz up too, and began to march over the
      eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Stop, now!' says the parson. 'I 'll make him get down agin: hand me that
      corn-basket; we 'll put that over him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he crooked old Tom's legs, and got him down agin; and they put the
      corn-basket over him, and then they both stood and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That 'll do the thing, Huldy,' said the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't know about it,' says Huldy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, yes, it will, child! I understand,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as he spoke, the basket riz right up and stood, and they could see
      old Tom's long legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I 'll make him stay down, confound him,' says the parson; for, ye see,
      parsons is men, like the rest on us, and the doctor had got his spunk up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You jist hold him a minute, and I 'll get something that 'll make him
      stay, I guess;' and out he went to the fence, and brought in a long, thin,
      flat stone, and laid it on old Tom's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Tom he wilted down considerable under this, and looked railly as if
      he was goin' to give in. He staid still there a good long spell, and the
      minister and Huldy left him there and come up to the house; but they
      hadn't more than got in the door before they see old Tom a hippin' along,
      as high-steppin' as ever, say in' 'Talk! talk! and quitter! quitter!' and
      struttin' and gobblin' as if he'd come through the Red Sea, and got the
      victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, my eggs!' says Huldy. 'I'm afraid he's smashed 'em!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sure enough, there they was, smashed flat enough under the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I 'll have him killed,' said the parson: 'we won't have such a critter
      'round.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the parson, he slep' on't, and then didn't do it: he only come out
      next Sunday with a tip-top sermon on the ''Riginal Cuss' that was
      pronounced on things in gineral, when Adam fell, and showed how every
      thing was allowed to go contrary ever since. There was pig-weed, and
      pusley, and Canady thistles, cut-worms, and bag-worms, and canker-worms,
      to say nothin' of rattlesnakes. The doctor made it very impressive and
      sort o' improvin'; but Huldy, she told me, goin' home, that she hardly
      could keep from laughin' two or three times in the sermon when she thought
      of old Tom a standin' up with the corn-basket on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, next week Huldy she jist borrowed the minister's horse and
      side-saddle, and rode over to South Parish to her Aunt Bascome's,&mdash;Widder
      Bascome's, you know, that lives there by the trout-brook,&mdash;and got a
      lot o' turkey-eggs o' her, and come back and set a hen on 'em, and said
      nothin'; and in good time there was as nice a lot o' turkey-chicks as ever
      ye see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huldy never said a word to the minister about his experiment, and he
      never said a word to her; but he sort o' kep' more to his books, and
      didn't take it on him to advise so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not long arter he took it into his head that Huldy ought to have a
      pig to be a fattin' with the buttermilk. Mis' Pipperidge set him up to it;
      and jist then old Tim Bigelow, out to Juniper Hill, told him if he'd call
      over he'd give him a little pig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he sent for a man, and told him to build a pigpen right out by the
      well, and have it all ready when he came home with his pig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huldy she said she wished he might put a curb round the well out there,
      because in the dark, sometimes, a body might stumble into it; and the
      parson, he told him he might do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, old Aikin, the carpenter, he didn't come till most the middle of the
      arternoon; and then he sort o' idled, so that he didn't get up the
      well-curb till sun down; and then he went off and said he'd come and do
      the pig-pen next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, arter dark, Parson Carryl he driv into the yard, full chizel, with
      his pig. He'd tied up his mouth to keep him from squeelin'; and he see
      what he thought was the pig-pen,&mdash;he was rather near-sighted,&mdash;and
      so he ran and threw piggy over; and down he dropped into the water, and
      the minister put out his horse and pranced off into the house quite
      delighted.

      &ldquo;'There, Huldy, I've got you a nice little pig.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dear me!' says Huldy: 'where have you put him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, out there in the pig-pen, to be sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, dear me!' says Huldy: 'that's the well-curb; there ain't no pig-pen
      built,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Lordy massy!' says the parson: 'then I've thrown the pig in the well!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Huldy she worked and worked, and finally she fished piggy out in the
      bucket, but he was dead as a door-nail; and she got him out o' the way
      quietly, and didn't say much; and the parson, he took to a great Hebrew
      book in his study; and says he, 'Huldy, I ain't much in temporals,' says
      he. Huldy says she kind o' felt her heart go out to him, he was so sort o'
      meek and helpless and larned; and says she, 'Wal, Parson Carryl, don't
      trouble your head no more about it; I 'll see to things;' and sure enough,
      a week arter there was a nice pen, all ship-shape, and two little white
      pigs that Huldy bought with the money for the butter she sold at the
      store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, Huldy,' said the parson, 'you are a most amazin' child: you don't
      say nothin', but you do more than most folks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arter that the parson set sich store by Huldy that he come to her and
      asked her about every thing, and it was amazin' how every thing she put
      her hand to prospered. Huldy planted marigolds and larkspurs, pinks and
      carnations, all up and down the path to the front door, and trained up
      mornin' glories and scar-, let-runners round the windows. And she was
      always a gettin' a root here, and a sprig there, and a seed from somebody
      else: for Huldy was one o' them that has the gift, so that ef you jist
      give 'em the leastest sprig of any thing they make a great bush out of it
      right away; so that in six months Huldy had roses and geraniums and
      lilies, sich as it would a took a gardener to raise. The parson, he took
      no notice at fust; but when the yard was all ablaze with flowers he used
      to come and stand in a kind o' maze at the front door, and say,
      'Beautiful, beautiful: why, Huldy, I never see any thing like it.' And
      then when her work was done arternoons, Huldy would sit with her sewin' in
      the porch, and sing and trill away till she'd draw the meadow-larks and
      the bobolinks, and the orioles to answer her, and the great big elm-tree
      overhead would get perfectly rackety with the birds; and the parson,
      settin' there in his study, would git to kind o' dreamin' about the
      angels, and golden harps, and the New Jerusalem; but he wouldn't speak a
      word, 'cause Huldy she was jist like them wood-thrushes, she never could
      sing so well when she thought folks was hearin'. Folks noticed, about this
      time, that the parson's sermons got to be like Aaron's rod, that budded
      and blossomed: there was things in 'em about flowers and birds, and more
      'special about the music o' heaven. And Huldy she noticed, that ef there
      was a hymn run in her head while she was 'round a workin' the minister was
      sure to give it out next Sunday. You see, Huldy was jist like a bee: she
      always sung when she was workin', and you could hear her trillin', now
      down in the corn-patch, while she was pickin' the corn; and now in the
      buttery, while she was workin' the butter; and now she'd go singin' down
      cellar, and then she'd be singin' up over head, so that she seemed to fill
      a house chock full o' music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huldy was so sort o' chipper and fair spoken, that she got the hired men
      all under her thumb: they come to her and took her orders jist as meek as
      so many calves; and she traded at the store, and kep' the accounts, and
      she hed her eyes everywhere, and tied up all the ends so tight that there
      want no get-tin' 'round her. She wouldn't let nobody put nothin' off on
      Parson Carryl, 'cause he was a minister. Huldy was allers up to anybody
      that wanted to make a hard bargain; and, afore he knew jist what he was
      about, she'd got the best end of it, and everybody said that Huldy was the
      most capable gal that they'd ever traded with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, come to the meetin' of the Association, Mis' Deakin Blodgett and
      Mis' Pipperidge come callin' up to the parson's, all in a stew, and
      offerin' their services to get the house ready; but the doctor, he jist
      thanked 'em quite quiet, and turned 'em over to Huldy; and Huldy she told
      'em that she'd got every thing ready, and showed 'em her pantries, and her
      cakes and her pies and her puddin's, and took 'em all over the house; and
      they went peekin' and pokin', openin' cupboard-doors, and lookin' into
      drawers; and they couldn't find so much as a thread out o' the way, from
      garret to cellar, and so they went off quite discontented. Arter that the
      women set a new trouble a brewin'. Then they begun to talk that it was a
      year now since Mis' Carryl died; and it r'ally wasn't proper such a young
      gal to be stayin' there, who everybody could see was a settin' her cap for
      the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis' Pipperidge said, that, so long as she looked on Huldy as the hired
      gal, she hadn't thought much about it; but Huldy was railly takin' on airs
      as an equal, and appearin' as mistress o' the house in a way that would
      make talk if it went on. And Mis' Pipperidge she driv 'round up to Deakin
      Abner Snow's, and down to Mis' 'Lijah Perry's, and asked them if they
      wasn't afraid that the way the parson and Huldy was a goin' on might make
      talk. And they said they hadn't thought on't before, but now, come to
      think on't, they was sure it would; and they all went and talked with
      somebody else, and asked them if they didn't think it would make talk. So
      come Sunday, between meetin's there warn't nothin' else talked about; and
      Huldy saw folks a noddin' and a winkin', and a lookin' arter her, and she
      begun to feel drefful sort o' disagreeable. Finally Mis' Sawin she says to
      her, 'My dear, didn't you, never think folk would talk about you and the
      minister?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No: why should they?' says Huldy, quite innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, dear,' says she, 'I think it's a shame; but they say you're tryin'
      to catch him, and that it's so bold and improper for you to be courtin' of
      him right in his own house,&mdash;you know folks will talk,&mdash;I
      thought I'd tell you 'cause I think so much of you,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huldy was a gal of spirit, and she despised the talk, but it made her
      drefful uncomfortable; and when she got home at night she sat down in the
      mor-nin'-glory porch, quite quiet, and didn't sing a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The minister he had heard the same thing from one of his deakins that
      day; and, when he saw Huldy so kind o' silent, he says to her, 'Why don't
      you sing, my child?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hed a pleasant sort o' way with him, the minister had, and Huldy had
      got to likin' to be with him, and it all come over her that perhaps she
      ought to go away; and her throat kind o' filled up so she couldn't hardly
      speak; and, says she, 'I can't sing to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Says he, 'You don't know how much good you're singin' has done me, nor
      how much good <i>you</i> have done me in all ways, Huldy. I wish I knew
      how to show my gratitude.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'O sir!' says Huldy, '<i>is</i> it improper for me to be here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, dear,' says the minister, 'but ill-natured folks will talk; but
      there is one way we can stop it, Huldy&mdash;if you will marry me. You 'll
      make me very happy, and I 'll do all I can to make you happy. Will you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Huldy never told me jist what she said to the minister,&mdash;gals
      never does give you the particulars of them 'are things jist as you'd like
      'em,&mdash;only I know the upshot and the hull on't was, that Huldy she
      did a consid'able lot o' clear starchin' and ironin' the next two days;
      and the Friday o' next week the minister and she rode over together to Dr.
      Lothrop's in Old Town; and the doctor, he jist made 'em man and wife,
      'spite of envy of the Jews,' as the hymn says. Wal, you'd better believe
      there was a starin' and a wonderin' next Sunday mornin' when the second
      bell was a tollin', and the minister walked up the broad aisle with Huldy,
      all in white, arm in arm with him, and he opened the minister's pew, and
      handed her in as if she was a princess; for, you see, Parson Carryl come
      of a good family, and was a born gentleman, and had a sort o' grand way o'
      bein' polite to women-folks. Wal, I guess there was a rus'lin' among the
      bunnets. Mis' Pipperidge gin a great bounce, like corn poppin' on a
      shovel, and her eyes glared through her glasses at Huldy as if they'd a
      sot her afire; and everybody in the meetin' house was a starin', I tell <i>yew</i>.
      But they couldn't none of 'em say nothin' agin Huldy's looks; for there
      wa'n't a crimp nor a frill about her that wa'n't jis' <i>so</i>; and her
      frock was white as the driven snow, and she had her bunnet all trimmed up
      with white ribbins; and all the fellows said the old doctor had stole a
      march, and got the handsomest gal in the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, arter meetin' they all come 'round the parson and Huldy at the door,
      shakin' hands and laughin'; for by that time they was about agreed that
      they'd got to let putty well alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, Parson Carryl,' says Mis' Deakin Blodgett, 'how you've come it over
      us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' says the parson, with a kind o' twinkle in his eye. 'I thought,'
      says he, 'as folks wanted to talk about Huldy and me, I'd give 'em
      somethin' wuth talkin' about.'&rdquo;

      It was the dripping end of a sour November afternoon, which closed up a
      &ldquo;spell o' weather&rdquo; that had been steadily driving wind and rain for a week
      past; and we boys sought the shelter and solace of his shop, and, opening
      the door, let in the wind aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam had been all day in one of his periodical fits of desperate industry.
      The smoke and sparks had been seen flying out of his shop-chimney in a
      frantic manner; and the blows of his hammer had resounded with a sort of
      feverish persistence, intermingled with a doleful wailing of psalm-tunes
      of the most lugubrious description.
    </p>
    <p>
      These fits of industry on Sam's part were an affliction to us boys,
      especially when they happened to come on Saturday: for Sam was as much a
      part of our Saturday-afternoon calculations as if we had a regular deed of
      property in him; and we had been all day hanging round his shop, looking
      in from time to time, in the vague hope that he would propose something to
      brighten up the dreary monotony of a holiday in which it had been
      impossible to go anywhere or do any thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam, ain't you coming over to tell us some stories to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your soul and body, boys! life ain't made to be spent tellin'
      stories. Why, I shall hev to be up here workin' till arter twelve
      o'clock,&rdquo; said Sam, who was suddenly possessed with a spirit of the most
      austere diligence. &ldquo;Here I be up to my neck in work,&mdash;things kind o'
      comin' in a heap together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Mis' Cap'n Broad's andirons, she sent word she must have 'em
      to-night; and there's Lady Lothrop, she wants her warmin'-pan right off;
      they can't non' on 'em wait a minit longer. I've ben a drivin' and workin'
      all day like a nigger-slave. Then there was Jeduth Pettybone, he brought
      down them colts to-day, and I worked the biggest part o' the mornin'
      shoein' on 'em; and then Jeduth he said he couldn't make change to pay me,
      so there wa'n't nothin' comin' in for 't; and then Hepsy she kep' a jawin'
      at me all dinner-time 'bout that. Why, I warn't to blame now, was I? I
      can't make everybody do jest right and pay regular, can I? So ye see it
      goes, boys, gettin' yer bread by the sweat o' your brow; and sometimes
      sweatin' and not gettin' yer bread. That 'ere's what I call the <i>cuss</i>,
      the 'riginal cuss, that come on man for hearkenin' to the voice o' his
      wife,&mdash;that 'ere was what did it. It allers kind o' riles me up with
      Mother Eve when I think on't. The women hain't no bisness to fret as they
      do, 'cause they sot this 'ere state o' things goin' in the fust place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sam, Aunt Lois and Aunt Nabby are both going over to Mis'
      Mehitabel's to tea. Now, you just come over and eat supper with us and
      tell us a story, do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone out to tea, be they?&rdquo; said Sam, relaxing his hammering, with a
      brightening gleam stealing gradually across his lanky visage. &ldquo;Wal, that
      'ere looks like a providential openin', to be sure. Wal, I guess I 'll
      come. What's the use o' never havin' a good time? Ef you work yourself up
      into shoestrings you don't get no thanks for it, and things in this
      world's 'bout as broad as they is long: the women 'll scold, turn 'em
      which way ye will. A good mug o' cider and some cold victuals over to the
      Deakin's 'll kind o' comfort a feller up; and your granny she's sort o'
      merciful, she don't rub it into a fellow all the time like Miss Lois.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let's see, boys,&rdquo; said Sam, when a comfortable meal of pork and
      beans had been disposed of, and a mug of cider was set down before the
      fire to warm. &ldquo;I s'pect ye 'll like to hear a Down-East story to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course we did, and tumbled over each other in our eagerness to get the
      nearest place to the narrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam's method of telling a story was as leisurely as that of some modern
      novel-writers. He would take his time for it, and proceed by easy stages.
      It was like the course of a dreamy, slow-moving river through a tangled
      meadow-flat,&mdash;not a rush nor a bush but was reflected in it; in
      short, Sam gave his philosophy of matters and things in general as he went
      along, and was especially careful to impress an edifying moral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, boys, ye know I was born down to Newport,&mdash;there where
      it's all ships and shipping, and sich. My old mother she kep' a
      boardin'-house for sailors down there. Wal, ye see, I rolled and tumbled
      round the world pretty consid'able afore I got settled down here in
      Oldtown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, my mother she wanted to bind me out to a blacksmith, but I kind
      o' sort o' didn't seem to take to it. It was kind o' hard work, and boys
      is apt to want to take life easy. Wal, I used to run off to the sea-shore,
      and lie stretched out on them rocks there, and look off on to the water;
      and it did use to look so sort o' blue and peaceful, and the ships come a
      sailin' in and out so sort o' easy and natural, that I felt as if that are
      'd be jest the easiest kind o' life a fellow could have. All he had to do
      was to get aboard one o' them ships, and be off seekin' his fortin at
      t'other end o' the rainbow, where gold grows on bushes and there's valleys
      o' diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, nothin' would do but I gin my old mother the slip; and away I went to
      sea, with my duds tied up in a han'kercher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell ye what, boys, ef ye want to find an easy life, don't ye never go
      to sea. I tell ye, life on shipboard ain't what it looks to be on shore. I
      hadn't been aboard more'n three hours afore I was the sickest critter that
      ever ye did see; and I tell you, I didn't get no kind o' compassion.
      Cap'ns and mates they allers thinks boys hain't no kind o' business to
      have no bowels nor nothin', and they put it on 'em sick or well. It's jest
      a kick here, and a cuff there, and a twitch by the ear in t'other place;
      one a shovin' on 'em this way, and another hittin' on 'em a clip, and all
      growlin' from mornin' to night. I believe the way my ears got so long was
      bein' hauled out o' my berth by 'em: that 'are's a sailor's regular way o'
      wakin' up a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, by time I got to the Penobscot country, all I wanted to know was how
      to get back agin. That 'are's jest the way folks go all their lives, boys.
      It's all fuss, fuss, and stew, stew, till ye get somewhere; and then it's
      fuss, fuss, and stew, stew, to get back agin; jump here and scratch yer
      eyes out, and jump there and scratch 'em in agin,&mdash;that 'are's life'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I kind o' poked round in Penobscot country till I got a berth on
      'The Brilliant' that was lyin' at Camden, goin' to sail to Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, 'The Brilliant' she was a tight little sloop in the government
      service: 'twas in the war-times, ye see, and Commodore Tucker that is now
      (he was Cap'n Tucker then), he had the command on her,&mdash;used to run
      up and down all the coast takin' observations o' the British, and keepin'
      his eye out on 'em and givin' on 'em a nip here and a clip there,' cordin'
      as he got a good chance. Why, your grand'ther knew old Commodore Tucker.
      It was he that took Dr. Franklin over Minister, to France, and dodged all
      the British vessels, right in the middle o' the war I tell you that 'are
      was like runnin' through the drops in a thunder-shower. He got chased by
      the British ships pretty consid'able, but he was too spry for 'em. Arter
      the war was over, Commodore Tucker took over John Adams, our fust Minister
      to England. A drefful smart man the Commodore was, but he most like to 'a'
      ben took in this'ere time I'm a tellin' ye about, and all 'cause he was
      sort o' softhearted to the women. Tom Toothacre told me the story. Tom he
      was the one that got me the berth on the ship. Ye see, I used to know Tom
      at Newport; and once when he took sick there my mother nussed him up, and
      that was why Tom was friends with me and got me the berth, and kep' me
      warm in it too. Tom he was one of your rael Maine boys, that's hatched
      out, so to speak, in water like ducks. He was born away down there on
      Harpswell P'int; and they say, if ye throw one o' them Harpswell babies
      into the sea, he 'll take to it nateral, and swim like a cork: ef they hit
      their heads agin a rock it only dents the rock, but don't hurt the baby.
      Tom he was a great character on the ship. He could see further, and knew
      more 'bout wind and water, than most folks: the officers took Tom's
      judgment, and the men all went by his say. My mother she chalked a streak
      o' good luck for me when she nussed up Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, we wus a lyin' at Camden there, one arter-noon, goin' to sail for
      Boston that night. It was a sort o' soft, pleasant arternoon, kind o'
      still, and there wa'n't nothin' a goin' on but jest the hens a
      craw-crawin', and a histin' up one foot, and holdin' it a spell 'cause
      they didn't know when to set it down, and the geese a sissin' and a
      pickin' at the grass. Ye see, Camden wasn't nothin' of a place,&mdash;'twas
      jest as if somebody had emptied out a pocketful o' houses and forgot 'em.
      There wer'n't nothin' a stirrin' or goin' on; and so we was all took
      aback, when 'bout four o'clock in the arternoon there come a boat
      alongside, with a tall, elegant lady in it, all dressed in deep mournin'.
      She rared up sort o' princess-like, and come aboard our ship, and wanted
      to speak to Cap 'll Tucker. Where she come from, or what she wanted, or
      where she was goin' to, we none on us knew: she kep' her veil down so we
      couldn't get sight o' her face. All was, she must see Cap'n Tucker alone
      right away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cap'n Tucker he was like the generality o' cap'ns. He was up to
      'bout every thing that any <i>man</i> could do, but it was pretty easy for
      a woman to come it over him. Ye see, cap'ns, they don't see women as men
      do ashore. They don't have enough of 'em to get tired on 'em; and every
      woman's an angel to a sea-cap'n. Anyway, the cap'n he took her into his
      cabin, and he sot her a chair, and was her humble servant to command, and
      what would she have of him? And we was all a winkin', and a nudgin' each
      other, and a peekin' to see what was to come o' it. And she see it; and so
      she asks, in a sort o' princess' way, to speak to the cap'n alone; and so
      the doors was shut, and we was left to our own ideas, and a wonderin' what
      it was all to be about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see, it come out arterwards all about what went on; and things
      went this way. Jest as soon as the doors was shut, and she was left alone
      with the cap'n, she busted out a cryin' and a sobbin'. lit to break her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the cap'n he tried to comfort her up: but no, she wouldn't be
      comforted, but went on a weepin' and a wailin,' and a wringin' on her
      hands, till the poor cap'n's heart was a'most broke; for the cap'n was the
      tenderest-hearted critter that could be, and couldn't bear to see a child
      or a woman in trouble noways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'O cap'n!' said she, 'I'm the most unfortunate woman. I'm all alone in
      the world,' says she, 'and I don't know what 'll become of me ef you don't
      keep me,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the cap'n thought it was time to run up his colors; and so says he,
      'Ma'am, I'm a married man, and love my wife,' says he, 'and so I can feel
      for all women in distress,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, then!' says she, 'you can feel for me, and know how to pity me.
      My dear husband's just died suddenly when he was up the river. He was took
      with the fever in the woods. I nussed him day and night,' says she; 'but
      he died there in a mis'able little hut far from home and friends,' says
      she; 'and I've brought his body down with me, hopin' Providence would open
      some way to get it back to our home in Boston. And now, cap'n, you must
      help me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the cap'n see what she was up to: and he hated to do it, and tried
      to cut her off o' askin'; but she wa'n't to be put off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, cap'n,' says she, 'ef you 'll take me and the body o' my husband on
      board to-night, I'd be willin' to reward you to any amount. Money would be
      no object to me,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see, the cap'n he kind o' hated to do it; and he hemmed and
      hawed, and he tried to 'pologize. He said 'twas a government vessel, and
      he didn't know as he had a right to use it. He said sailors was apt to be
      superstitious; and he didn't want 'em to know as there was a corpse on
      board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says she, 'why need they know?' For, you see, she was up to every
      dodge; and she said she'd come along with it at dusk, in a box, and have
      it just carried to a state-room, and he needn't tell nobody what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cap'n Tucker he hung off; and he tried his best to persuade her to
      have a funeral, all quiet, there at Camden. He promised to get a minister,
      and 'tend to it, and wait a day till it was all over, and then take her on
      to Boston free gratis. But 'twas all no go. She wouldn't hear a word to
      't. And she reeled off the talk to him by the yard. And, when talk failed,
      she took to her water-works again, till finally the cap'n said his
      resolution was clean washed away, and he jest give up hook and line; and
      so 'twas all settled and arranged, that, when evening come, she was to be
      alongside with her boat, and took aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she come out o' the cap'n's room to go off, I see Tom Toothacre a
      watchin' on her. He stood there by the railin's a shavin' up a plug o'
      baccy to put in his pipe. He didn't say a word; but he sort o' took the
      measure o' that 'are woman with his eye, and kept a follerin' on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had a fine sort o' lively look, carried her head up and shoulders
      back, and stepped as if she had steel springs in her heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, Tom, what do ye say to her?' says Ben Bowdin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't <i>say</i> nothin',' says Tom, and he lit his pipe; 'tain't <i>my</i>
      busness,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, what do you <i>think?</i>' says Ben. Tom gin a hist to his
      trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'My thoughts is my own,' says he; 'and I calculate to keep 'em to
      myself,' says he. And then he jest walked to the side of the vessel, and
      watched the woman a gettin' ashore. There was a queer kind o look in Tom's
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the cap'n he was drefful sort o' oneasy arter she was gone. He had a
      long talk in the cabin with Mr. More, the fust officer; and there was a
      sort o' stir aboard as if somethin' was a goin' to happen, we couldn't
      jest say what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes it seems as if, when things is goin' to happen, a body kind o'
      feels 'em comin' in the air. We boys was all that way: o' course we didn't
      know nothin' 'bout what the woman wanted, or what she come for, or whether
      she was comin' agin; 'n fact, we didn't know nothin' about it, and yet we
      sort o' expected suthin' to come o' it; and suthin' did come, sure enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on night, jest at dusk, we see a boat comin' alongside; and there,
      sure enough, was the lady in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There, she's comin' agin,' says I to Tom Tooth acre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, and brought her baggage with her,' says Tom; and he p'inted down to
      a long, narrow pine box that was in the boat beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest then the cap'n called on Mr. More, and he called on Tom Toothacre;
      and among 'em they lowered a tackle, and swung the box aboard, and put it
      in the state-room right alongside the cap'n's cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady she thanked the cap'n and Mr. More, and her voice was jest as
      sweet as any nightingale; and she went into the state-room arter they put
      the body in, and was gone ever so long with it. The cap'n and Mr. More
      they stood a whisperin' to each other, and every once in a while they'd
      kind o' nod at the door where the lady was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, by and by she come out with her han'ker-chief to her eyes, and come
      on deck, and begun talkin' to the cap'n and Mr. More, and a wishin' all
      kinds o' blessin's on their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Tom Toothacre didn't say a word, good or bad; but he jest kep' a
      lookin' at her, watchin' her as a cat watches a mouse. Finally we up sail,
      and started with a fair breeze. The lady she kep' a walkin' up and down,
      up and down, and every time she turned on her heel, I saw Tom a lookin'
      arter her and kind o' noddin' to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What makes you look arter her so, Tom?' says I to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;''Cause I think she <i>wants</i> lookin' arter,' says Tom. 'What's more,'
      says he, 'if the cap'n don't look sharp arter her the devil 'll have us
      all afore mornin.' I tell ye, Sam, there's mischief under them petticuts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, what do ye think?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Think! I don't think, I knows! That 'are's no gal, nor widder neither,
      if my name's Tom Tooth-acre! Look at her walk; look at the way she turns
      on her heel! I've been a watchin' on her. There ain't no woman livin' with
      a step like that!' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, who should the critter be, then?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says Tom, 'ef that 'are ain't a British naval officer, I lose my
      bet. I've been used to the ways on 'em, and I knows their build and their
      step.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And what do you suppose she's got in that long box?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What has she got?' says Tom. 'Wal, folks might say none o' my bisness;
      but I s'pects it 'll turn out some o' my bisness, and yourn too, if he
      don't look sharp arter it,' says Tom. 'It's no good, that 'are box ain't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why don't you speak to Mr. More?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, you see she's a chipperin' round and a-makin' herself agreeable to
      both on 'em, you see; she don't mean to give nobody any chance for a talk
      with 'em; but I've got my eye on her, for all that. You see I hain't no
      sort o' disposition to sarve out a time on one o' them British
      prison-ships,' says Tom Toothacre. 'It might be almighty handy for them
      British to have &ldquo;The Brilliant&rdquo; for a coast-vessel,' says he; 'but, ye
      see, it can't be spared jest yet. So, madam,' says he, 'I've got my eye on
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Tom was as good as his word; for when Mr. More came towards him at
      the wheel, Tom he up and says to him, 'Mr. More,' says he, that 'are big
      box in the state-room yonder wants lookin' into.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom was a sort o' privileged character, and had a way o' speakin' up that
      the officers took in good part, 'cause they knew he was a fust-rate hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Mr. More he looks mysterious; and says he, Tom, do the boys know
      what's in that 'are box?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I bet they don't,' says Tom. 'If they had, you wouldn't a got 'em to
      help it aboard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, you see, poor woman,' says Mr. More to Tom, 'she was so distressed.
      She wanted to get her husband's body to Boston; and there wa'n't no other
      way, and so the cap'n let it come aboard. He didn't want the boys to
      suspect what it really was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Husband's body be hanged!' said Tom. 'Guess that 'are corpse ain't so
      dead but what there 'll be a resurrection afore mornin', if it ain't
      looked arter,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, what do you mean, Tom?' said Mr. More, all in a blue maze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I mean, that 'are gal that's ben a switchin' her petticuts up and down
      our deck ain't no gal at all. That are's a British officer, Mr. More. You
      give my duty to the cap'n, and tell him to look into his widder's bandbox,
      and see what he 'll find there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the mate he went and had a talk with the cap'n; and they 'greed
      between 'em that Mr. More was to hold her in talk while the cap'n went and
      took observations in the state-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, down the cap'n goes into the state-room to give a look at the box.
      Wal, he finds the stateroom door all locked to be sure, and my lady had
      the key in her pocket; but then the cap'n he had a master key to it; and
      so he puts it in, and opens the door quite softly, and begins to take
      observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure enough, he finds that the screws had been drawed from the top o' the
      box, showin' that the widder had been a tinkerin' on't when they thought
      she was a cryin' over it; and then, lookin' close, he sees a bit o' twine
      goin' from a crack in the box out o' the winder, and up on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the cap'n he kind o' got in the sperit o' the thing; and he thought
      he'd jest let the widder play her play out, and see what it would come to.
      So he jest calls Tom Toothacre down to him and whispered to him. 'Tom,'
      says he, 'you jest crawl under the berth in that 'are state-room, and
      watch that 'are box.' And Tom said he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Tom creeps under the berth, and lies there still as a mouse; and the
      cap'n he slips out and turns the key in the door, so that when madam comes
      down she shouldn't s'pect nothin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Putty soon, sure enough, Tom heard the lock rattle, and the young widder
      come in; and then he heard a bit o' conversation between her and the
      corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What time is it?' come in a kind o' hoarse whisper out o' the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, 'bout nine o'clock,' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How long afore you 'll let me out?' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh! you must have patience,' says she, 'till they're all gone off to
      sleep; when there ain't but one man up. I can knock him down,' says she,
      'and then I 'll pull the string for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The devil you will, ma'am!' says Tom to himself, under the berth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, it's darned close here,' says the fellow in the box. He didn't say
      darned, boys; but he said a wickeder word that I can't repeat, noways,&rdquo;
       said Sam, in a parenthesis: &ldquo;these 'ere British officers was drefful
      swearin' critters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You must have patience a while longer,' says the lady, 'till I pull the
      string.' Tom Toothacre lay there on his back a laughin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Is every thing goin' on right?' says the man in the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'All straight,' says she: 'there don't none of 'em suspect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You bet,' says Tom Toothacre, under the berth; and he said he had the
      greatest mind to catch the critter by the feet as she was a standin'
      there, but somehow thought it would be better fun to see the thing through
      'cording as they'd planned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, then she went off switchin' and mincin' up to the deck agin, and a
      flirtin' with the cap'n; for you see 'twas 'greed to let 'em play their
      play out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Tom he lay there a waitin'; and he waited and waited and waited,
      till he 'most got asleep; but finally he heard a stirrin' in the box, as
      if the fellah was a gettin' up. Tom he jest crawled out still and kerful,
      and stood up tight agin the wall. Putty soon he hears a grunt, and he sees
      the top o' the box a risin' up, and a man jest gettin' out on't mighty
      still.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Tom he waited till he got fairly out on to the floor, and had his
      hand on the lock o' the door, when he jumps on him, and puts both arms
      round him, and gin him a regular bear's hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, what's this?' says the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Guess ye 'll find out, darn ye,' says Tom Tooth-acre. 'So, ye wanted our
      ship, did ye? Wal, ye jest can't have our ship,' says Tom, says he; and I
      tell you he jest run that 'are fellow up stairs lickety-split, for Tom was
      strong as a giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fust thing they saw was Mr. More hed got the widder by both arms, and
      was tying on 'em behind her. 'Ye see, madam, your game's up,' says Mr.
      More, 'but we 'll give ye a free passage to Boston, tho',' says he: 'we
      wanted a couple o' prisoners about these days, and you 'll do nicely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellers they was putty chopfallen, to be sure, and the one in women's
      clothes 'specially: 'cause when he was found out, he felt foolish enough
      in his petticuts; but they was both took to Boston, and given over as
      prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, come to look into matters, they found these two young fellows,
      British officers, had formed a regular plot to take Cap'n Tucker's vessel,
      and run it into Halifax; and ye see, Cap'n Tucker he was so sort o' spry,
      and knew all the Maine coast so well, and was so 'cute at dodgin' in and
      out all them little bays and creeks and places all 'long shore, that he
      made the British considerable trouble, 'cause wherever they didn't want
      him, that's where he was sure to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they'd hatched up this 'ere plan. There was one or two British sailors
      had been and shipped aboard 'The Brilliant' a week or two aforehand, and
      'twas suspected they was to have helped in the plot if things had gone as
      they laid out; but I tell you, when the fellows see which way the cat
      jumped, they took pretty good care to say that they hadn't nothin' to do
      with it. Oh, no, by no manner o' means! Wal, o' course, ye know, it
      couldn't be proved on 'em, and so we let it go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you, Cap'n Tucker he felt pretty cheap about his widder. The
      worst on't was, they do say Ma'am Tucker got hold of it; and you might
      know if a woman got hold of a thing like that she'd use it as handy as a
      cat would her claws. The women they can't no more help hittin' a fellow a
      clip and a rap when they've fairly got him, than a cat when she's ketched
      a mouse; and so I shouldn't wonder if the Commodore heard something about
      his widder every time he went home from his v'yages the longest day he had
      to live. I don't know nothin' 'bout it, ye know: I only kind o' jedge by
      what looks, as human natur' goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Lordy massy! boys,' 't wa'n't nothin' to be 'shamed of in the cap'n.
      Folks 'll have to answer for wus things at the last day than tryin' to do
      a kindness to a poor widder, now, I tell <i>you</i>. It's better to be
      took in doin' a good thing, than never try to do good; and it's my settled
      opinion,&rdquo; said Sam, taking up his mug of cider and caressing it tenderly,
      &ldquo;it's my humble opinion, that the best sort o' folks is the easiest took
      in, 'specially by the women. I reely don't think I should a done a bit
      better myself.&rdquo;

    <p>
      NE of our most favorite legendary resorts was the old barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam Lawson preferred it on many accounts. It was quiet and retired, that
      is to say, at such distance from his own house, that he could not hear if
      Hepsy called ever so loudly, and farther off than it would be convenient
      for that industrious and painstaking woman to follow him. Then there was
      the soft fragrant cushion of hay, on which his length of limb could be
      easily bestowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our barn had an upper loft with a swinging outer door that commanded a
      view of the old mill, the waterfall, and the distant windings of the
      river, with its grassy green banks, its graceful elm draperies, and its
      white flocks of water-lilies; and then on this Saturday afternoon we had
      Sam all to ourselves. It was a drowsy, dreamy October day, when the hens
      were lazily &ldquo;craw, crawing,&rdquo; in a soft, conversational undertone with each
      other, as they scratched and picked the hay-seed under the barn windows.
      Below in the barn black Cæsar sat quietly hatchelling flax, sometimes
      gurgling and giggling to himself with an overflow of that interior jollity
      with which he seemed to be always full. The African in New England was a
      curious contrast to everybody around him in the joy and satisfaction that
      he seemed to feel in the mere fact of being alive. Every white person was
      glad or sorry for some appreciable cause in the past, present, or future,
      which was capable of being definitely stated; but black Cæsar was in an
      eternal giggle and frizzle and simmer of enjoyment for which he could give
      no earthly reason: he was an &ldquo;embodied joy,&rdquo; like Shelley's skylark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest hear him,&rdquo; said Sam Lawson, looking pensively over the hay-mow, and
      strewing hayseed down on his wool. &ldquo;How that 'are critter seems to tickle
      and laugh all the while 'bout nothin'. Lordy massy! he don't seem never to
      consider that 'this life's a dream, an empty show.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Sam,&rdquo; we broke in, anxious to cut short a threatened stream of
      morality, &ldquo;you promised to tell us about Capt. Kidd, and how you dug for
      his money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I, now? Wal, boys, that 'are history o' Kidd's is a warnin' to
      fellers. Why, Kidd had pious parents and Bible and sanctuary privileges
      when he was a boy, and yet come to be hanged. It's all in this 'ere song
      I'm a goin' to sing ye. Lordy massy! I wish I had my bass-viol now.&mdash;Cæsar,&rdquo;
       he said, calling down from his perch, &ldquo;can't you strike the pitch o'
      'Cap'n Kidd,' on your fiddle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cæsar's fiddle was never far from him. It was, in fact, tucked away in a
      nice little nook just over the manger; and he often caught an interval
      from his work to scrape a dancing-tune on it, keeping time with his heels,
      to our great delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A most wailing minor-keyed tune was doled forth, which seemed quite
      refreshing to Sam's pathetic vein, as he sang in his most lugubrious
      tones,&mdash;

      &ldquo;There was a good deal more on't,&rdquo; said Sam, pausing, &ldquo;but I don't seem to

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was Capt. Kidd, Sam?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, he was an officer in the British navy, and he got to bein' a pirate:
      used to take ships and sink 'em, and murder the folks; and so they say he
      got no end o' money,&mdash;gold and silver and precious stones, as many as
      the wise men in the East. But ye see, what good did it all do him? He
      couldn't use it, and dar'sn't keep it; so he used to bury it in spots
      round here and there in the awfullest heathen way ye ever heard of. Why,
      they say he allers used to kill one or two men or women or children of his
      prisoners, and bury with it, so that their sperits might keep watch on it
      ef anybody was to dig arter it. That 'are thing has been tried and tried
      and tried, but no man nor mother's son on 'em ever got a cent that dug.
      'Twas tried here'n Oldtown; and they come pretty nigh gettin' on't, but it
      gin 'em the slip. Ye see, boys, <i>it's the Devil's money</i>, and he
      holds a pretty tight grip on't.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how was it about digging for it? Tell us, did <i>you</i> do it?
      Were <i>you</i> there? Did you see it? And why couldn't they get it?&rdquo; we
      both asked eagerly and in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Lordy massy I boys, your questions tumbles over each other thick as
      martins out o' a martin-box. Now, you jest be moderate and let alone, and
      I 'll tell you all about it from the beginnin' to the end. I didn't railly
      have no hand in't, though I was knowin' to 't, as I be to most things that
      goes on round here; but my conscience wouldn't railly a let me start on no
      sich undertakin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the one that fust sot the thing a goin' was old Mother Hokum, that
      used to live up in that little tumble-down shed by the cranberry-pond up
      beyond the spring pastur'. They had a putty bad name, them Hokums. How
      they got a livin' nobody knew; for they didn't seem to pay no attention to
      raisin' nothin' but childun, but the duce knows, there was plenty o' them.
      Their old hut was like a rabbit-pen: there was a tow-head to every crack
      and cranny. 'Member what old Cæsar said once when the word come to the
      store that old Hokum had got twins. 'S'pose de Lord knows best,' says
      Cæsar, 'but <i>I</i> thought dere was Hokums enough afore.' Wal, even poor
      workin' industrious folks like me finds it's hard gettin' along when
      there's so many mouths to feed. Lordy massy! there don't never seem to be
      no end on't, and so it ain't wonderful, come to think on't, ef folks like
      them Hokums gets tempted to help along in ways that ain't quite right.
      Anyhow, folks did use to think that old Hokum was too sort o' familiar
      with their wood-piles 'long in the night, though they couldn't never prove
      it on him; and when Mother Hokum come to houses round to wash, folks use
      sometimes to miss pieces, here and there, though they never could find 'em
      on her; then they was allers a gettin' in debt here and a gettin' in debt
      there. Why, they got to owin' two dollars to Joe Gidger for butcher's
      meat. Joe was sort o' good-natured and let 'em have meat, 'cause Hokum he
      promised so fair to pay; but he couldn't never get it out o' him. 'Member
      once Joe walked clear up to the cranberry-pond arter that 'are two
      dollars; but Mother Hokum she see him a comin' jest as he come past the
      juniper-bush on the corner. She says to Hokum, 'Get into bed, old man,
      quick, and let me tell the story,' says she. So she covered him up; and
      when Gidger come in she come up to him, and says she, 'Why, Mr. Gidger,
      I'm jest ashamed to see ye: why, Mr. Hokum was jest a comin' down to pay
      ye that 'are money last week, but ye see he was took down with the
      small-pox'&mdash;Joe didn't hear no more: he just turned round, and he
      streaked it out that 'are door with his coat-tails flyin' out straight
      ahind him; and old Mother Hokum she jest stood at the window holdin' her
      sides and laughin' fit to split, to see him run. That 'are's jest a sample
      o' the ways them Hokums cut up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see, boys, there's a queer kind o' rock down on the bank 'o the
      river, that looks sort o' like a grave-stone. The biggest part on't is
      sunk down under ground, and it's pretty well growed over with
      blackberry-vines; but, when you scratch the bushes away, they used to make
      out some queer marks on that 'are rock. They was sort o' lines and
      crosses; and folks would have it that them was Kidd's private marks, and
      that there was one o' the places where he hid his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, there's no sayin' fairly how it come to be thought so; but fellers
      used to say so, and they used sometimes to talk it over to the tahvern,
      and kind o' wonder whether or no, if they should dig, they wouldn't come
      to suthin'.
    </p>

      &ldquo;Wal, old Mother Hokum she heard on't, and she was a sort o' enterprisin'
      old crittur: fact was, she had to be, 'cause the young Hokums was jest
      like bag-worms, the more they growed the more they eat, and I expect she
      found it pretty hard to fill their mouths; and so she said ef there <i>was</i>
      any thing under that 'are rock, they'd as good's have it as the Devil; and
      so she didn't give old Hokum no peace o' his life, but he must see what
      there was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I was with 'em the night they was a talkin' on't up. Ye see, Hokum
      he got thirty-seven cents' worth o' lemons and sperit. I see him goin' by
      as I was out a splittin' kindlin's; and says he, 'Sam, you jest go 'long
      up to our house to-night,' says he: 'Toddy Whitney and Harry Wiggin's
      comin' up, and we're goin' to have a little suthin' hot,' says he; and he
      kind o' showed me the lemons and sperit. And I told him I guessed I would
      go 'long. Wal, I kind o' wanted to see what they'd be up to, ye know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, come to find out, they was a talkin' about Cap'n Kidd's treasures,
      and layin' out how they should get it, and a settin' one another on with
      gret stories about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I've heard that there was whole chists full o gold guineas,' says one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And I've heard o' gold bracelets and ear-rings and finger-rings all
      sparklin' with diamonds,' says another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Maybe it's old silver plate from some o' them old West Indian grandees,'
      says another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, whatever it is,' says Mother Hokum, 'I want to be into it,' says
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, Sam, won't you jine?' says they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, boys,' says I, 'I kind a' don't feel jest like j'inin'. I sort o'
      ain't clear about the rights on't: seems to me it's mighty nigh like goin'
      to the Devil for money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says Mother Hokum, 'what if 'tis? Money's money, get it how ye
      will; and the Devil's money 'll buy as much meat as any. I'd go to the
      Devil, if he gave good money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, I guess I wouldn't,' says I. 'Don't you 'member the sermon Parson
      Lothrop preached about hastin' to be rich, last sabba' day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Parson Lothrop be hanged!' says she. 'Wal, now,' says she, 'I like to
      see a parson with his silk stockin's and great gold-headed cane, a
      lollopin' on his carriage behind his fat, prancin' hosses, comin' to
      meetin' to preach to us poor folks not to want to be rich! How'd he like
      it to have forty-'leven children, and nothin' to put onto 'em or into 'em,
      I wonder? Guess if Lady Lothrop had to rub and scrub, and wear her fingers
      to the bone as I do, she'd want to be rich; and I guess the parson, if he
      couldn't get a bellyful for a week, would be for diggin' up Kidd's money,
      or doing 'most any thing else to make the pot bile.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says I, 'I 'll kind o' go with ye, boys, and sort o' see how
      things turn out; but I guess I won't take no shere in't,' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, they got it all planned out. They was to wait till the full moon,
      and then they was to get Primus King to go with 'em and help do the
      diggin'. Ye see, Hokum and Toddy Whitney and Wiggin are all putty softly
      fellers, and hate dreffully to work; and I tell you the Kidd money ain't
      to be got without a pretty tough piece o' diggin'. Why, it's jest like
      diggin' a well to get at it. Now, Primus King was the master hand for
      diggin' wells, and so they said they'd get him by givin' on him a shere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry Wiggin he didn't want no nigger a sherin in it, he said; but Toddy
      and Hokum they said that when there was such stiff diggin' to be done,
      they didn't care if they did go in with a nigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Wiggin he said he hadn't no objection to havin' the nigger do the
      diggin,' it was <i>alterin' the profits</i> he objected to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says Hokum, 'you can't get him without,' says he. 'Primus knows
      too much,' says he: 'you can't fool him.' Finally they 'greed that they
      was to give Primus twenty dollars, and shere the treasure 'mong
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to talk with Primus, he wouldn't stick in a spade, unless they'd pay
      him aforehand. Ye see, Primus was up to 'em; he knowed about Gidger, and
      there wa'n't none on 'em that was particular good pay; and so they all
      jest hed to rake and scrape, and pay him down the twenty dollars among
      'em; and they 'greed for the fust full moon, at twelve o'clock at night,
      the 9th of October.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see I had to tell Hepsy I was goin' out to watch. Wal, so I was;
      but not jest in the way she took it: but, Lordy massy! a feller has to
      tell his wife suthin' to keep her quiet, ye know, 'specially Hepsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, wal, of all the moonlight nights that ever I did see, I never did
      see one equal to that. Why, you could see the color o' every thing. I
      'member I could see how the huckleberry-bushes on the rock was red as
      blood when the moonlight shone through 'em; 'cause the leaves, you see,
      had begun to turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin' on our way we got to talkin' about the sperits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I ain't afraid on 'em,' says Hokum. 'What harm can a sperit do me?' says
      he. 'I don't care ef there's a dozen on 'em;' and he took a swig at his
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh! there ain't no sperits,' says Harry Wiggin. 'That 'are talk's all
      nonsense;' and he took a swig at <i>his</i> bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says Toddy, 'I don't know 'bout that 'are. Me and Ike Sanders has
      seen the sperits in the Cap'n Brown house. We thought we'd jest have a
      peek into the window one night; and there was a whole flock o' black colts
      without no heads on come rushin' on us and knocked us flat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I expect you'd been at the tahvern,' said Hokum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, yes, we had; but them was sperits: we wa'n't drunk, now; we was
      jest as sober as ever we was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, they won't get away my money,' says Primus, for I put it safe away
      in Dinah's teapot afore I come out;' and then he showed all his ivories
      from ear to ear. 'I think all this 'are's sort o' foolishness,' says
      Primus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says I, 'boys, I ain't a goin' to have no part or lot in this 'ere
      matter, but I 'll jest lay it off to you how it's to be done. Ef Kidd's
      money is under this rock, there's <i>sperits</i> that watch it, and you
      mustn't give 'em no advantage. There mustn't be a word spoke from the time
      ye get sight o' the treasure till ye get it safe up on to firm ground,'
      says I. 'Ef ye do, it 'll vanish right out o' sight. I've talked with them
      that has dug down to it and seen it; but they allers lost it, 'cause
      they'd call out and say suthin'; and the minute they spoke, away it went.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, so they marked off the ground; and Primus he begun to dig, and the
      rest kind o' sot round. It was so still it was kind o' solemn. Ye see, it
      was past twelve o'clock, and every critter in Oldtown was asleep; and
      there was two whippoorwills on the great Cap'n Brown elm-trees, that kep'
      a answerin' each other back and forward sort o' solitary like; and then
      every once in a while there'd come a sort o' strange whisper up among the
      elm-tree leaves, jest as if there was talkin' goin' on; and every time
      Primus struck his spade into the ground it sounded sort o' holler, jest as
      if he'd been a diggin' a grave. 'It's kind o' melancholy,' says I, 'to
      think o' them poor critters that had to be killed and buried jest to keep
      this 'ere treasure. What awful things 'll be brought to light in the
      judgment day! Them poor critters they loved to live and hated to die as
      much as any on us; but no, they hed to die jest to satisfy that critter's
      wicked will. I've heard them as thought they could tell the Cap'n Kidd
      places by layin' their ear to the ground at midnight, and they'd hear
      groans and wailin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sam! were there really people who could tell where Kidd's money
      was?&rdquo; I here interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, sartin! why, yis. There was Shebna Bascom, he was one. Shebna could
      always tell what was under the earth. He'd cut a hazel-stick, and hold it
      in his hand when folks was wantin' to know where to dig wells; and that
      'are stick would jest turn in his hand, and p'int down till it would
      fairly grind the bark off; and ef you dug in that place you was sure to
      find a spring. Oh, yis! Shebna he's told many where the Kidd money was,
      and been with 'em when they dug for it; but the pester on't was they
      allers lost it, 'cause they would some on 'em speak afore they thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sam, what about this digging? Let's know what came of it,&rdquo; said we,
      as Sam appeared to lose his way in his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, they dug down about five feet, when Primus he struck his
      spade smack on something that chincked like iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0015" id="linkimage-0015"> </a>

      <a href="images/0141.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, then Hokum and Toddy Whitney was into the hole in a minute: they
      made Primus get out, and they took the spade, 'cause they wanted to be
      sure to come on it themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, they begun, and they dug and he scraped, and sure enough they come
      to a gret iron pot as big as your granny's dinner-pot, with an iron bale
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, then they put down a rope, and he put the rope through the handle;
      then Hokum and Toddy they clambered upon the bank, and all on 'em began to
      draw up jest as still and silent as could be. They drawed and they drawed,
      till they jest got it even with the ground, when Toddy spoke out all in a
      tremble, 'There,' says he, <i>we've got it!</i>' And the minit he spoke
      they was both struck by <i>suthin''</i> that knocked 'em clean over; and
      the rope give a crack like a pistol-shot, and broke short off; and the pot
      went down, down, down, and they heard it goin', jink, jink, jink; and it
      went way down into the earth, and the ground closed over it; and then they
      heard the screechin'est laugh ye ever did hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know, Sam, did you see that pot?&rdquo; I exclaimed at this part of
      the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, no, I didn't. Ye see, I jest happened to drop asleep while they was
      diggin', I was so kind o' tired, and I didn't wake up till it was all
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was waked up, 'cause there was consid'able of a scuffle; for Hokum was
      so mad at Toddy for speakin', that he was a fistin' on him; and old Primus
      he jest haw-hawed and laughed. 'Wal, I got <i>my</i> money safe, anyhow,'
      says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, come to,' says I. ''Tain't no use cryin' for spilt milk: you've
      jest got to turn in now and fill up this 'ere hole, else the selectmen 'll
      be down on ye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says Primus, 'I didn't engage to fill up no holes;' and he put his
      spade on his shoulder and trudged off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, it was putty hard work, fillin' in that hole; but Hokum and Toddy
      and Wiggin had to do it, 'cause they didn't want to have everybody a
      laughin' at 'em; and I kind o' tried to set it home to 'em, showin' on 'em
      that 'twas all for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ef you'd a been left to get that 'are money, there'd a come a cuss with
      it,' says I. 'It shows the vanity o' hastin' to be rich.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, you shet up!' says Hokum, says he. 'You never hasted to any thing,'
      says he. Ye see, he was riled, that's why he spoke so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said we, after maturely reflecting over the story, &ldquo;what do you
      suppose was in that pot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy! boys: ye never will be done askin' questions. Why, how

    <p>
      E see, boys,&rdquo; said Sam Lawson, as we were gathering young wintergreen on a
      sunny hillside in June,&mdash;&ldquo;ye see, folks don't allers know what their
      marcies is when they sees 'em. Folks is kind o' blinded; and, when a
      providence comes along, they don't seem to know how to take it, and they
      growl and grumble about what turns out the best things that ever happened
      to 'em in their lives. It's like Mis' Elderkin's pitcher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Mis' Elderkin's pitcher?&rdquo; said both of us in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I never tell ye, now?&rdquo; said Sam: &ldquo;why, I wanter know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, we were sure he never had told us; and Sam as usual, began clearing
      the ground by a thorough introduction, with statistical expositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, Mis' Elderkin she lives now over to Sherburne in about the
      handsomest house in Sherburne,&mdash;a high white house, with green blinds
      and white pillars in front,&mdash;and she rides out in her own kerridge;
      and Mr. Elderkin, he's a deakin in the church, and a colonel in the
      malitia, and a s'lectman, and pretty much atop every thing there is goin'
      in Sherburne, and it all come of that 'are pitcher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What pitcher?&rdquo; we shouted in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy! that 'are's jest what I'm a goin' to tell you about; but, ye
      see, a feller's jest got to make a beginnin' to all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis' Elderkin she thinks she's a gret lady nowadays, I s'pose; but I
      'member when she was Miry Brown over here'n Oldtown, and I used to be
      waitin' on her to singing-school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miry and I was putty good friends along in them days,&mdash;we was putty
      consid'able kind o' intimate. Fact is, boys, there was times in them days
      when I thought whether or no I wouldn't <i>take</i> Miry myself,&rdquo; said
      Sam, his face growing luminous with the pleasing idea of his former
      masculine attractions and privileges. &ldquo;Yis,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there was a
      time when folks said I could a hed Miry ef I'd asked her; and I putty much
      think so myself, but I didn't say nothin': marriage is allers kind
      o'ventursome; an' Miry had such up-and-down kind o' ways, I was sort o'
      fraid on't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Lordy massy! boys, you mustn't never tell Hepsy I said so, 'cause
      she'd be mad enough to bite a shingle-nail in two. Not that she sets so
      very gret by me neither; but then women's backs is allers up ef they think
      anybody else could a hed you, whether they want you themselves or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, Miry she was old Black Hoss John Brown's da'ter, and lived up
      there in that 'are big brown house by the meetin'-house, that 'hes the red
      hollyhock in the front yard. Miry was about the handsomest gal that went
      into the singers' seat a Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you she wa'n't none o' your milk-and-sugar gals neither,&mdash;she
      was 'mazin' strong built. She was the strongest gal in her arms that I
      ever see. Why, I've seen Miry take up a barrel o' flour, and lift it right
      into the kitchen; and it would jest make the pink come into her cheeks
      like two roses, but she never seemed to mind it a grain. She had a good
      strong back of her own, and she was straight as a poplar, with snappin'
      black eyes, and I tell you there was a snap to her tongue too. Nobody
      never got ahead o' Miry; she'd give every fellow as good as he sent, but
      for all that she was a gret favorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miry was one o' your briery, scratchy gals, that seems to catch fellers
      in thorns. She allers fit and flouted her beaux, and the more she fit and
      flouted 'em the more they'd be arter her. There wa'n't a gal in all
      Oldtown that led such a string o' fellers arter her; 'cause, you see,
      she'd now and then throw 'em a good word over her shoulder, and then
      they'd all fight who should get it, and she'd jest laugh to see 'em do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there was Tom Sawin, he was one o' her beaux, and Jim Moss, and Ike
      Bacon; and there was a Boston boy, Tom Beacon, he came up from Cambridge
      to rusticate with Parson Lothrop; he thought he must have his say with
      Miry, but he got pretty well come up with. You see, he thought 'cause he
      was Boston born that he was kind o' aristocracy, and hed a right jest to
      pick and choose 'mong country gals; but the way he got come up with by
      Miry was too funny for any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell us about it,&rdquo; we said, as Sam made an artful pause, designed to
      draw forth solicitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, Tom Beacon he told Ike Bacon about it, and Ike he told me.
      'Twas this way. Ye see, there was a quiltin' up to Mis' Cap'n Broad's, and
      Tom Beacon he was there; and come to goin' home with the gals, Tom he cut
      Ike out, and got Miry all to himself; and 'twas a putty long piece of a
      walk from Mis' Cap'n Broad's up past the swamp and the stone pastur' clear
      up to old Black Hoss John's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Tom he was in high feather 'cause Miry took him, so that he didn't
      reelly know how to behave; and so, as they was walkin' along past Parson
      Lothrop's apple-orchard, Tom thought he'd try bein' familiar, and he
      undertook to put his arm round Miry. Wal, if she didn't jest take that
      little fellow by his two shoulders and whirl him over the fence into the
      orchard quicker'n no time. 'Why,' says Tom, 'the fust I knew I was lyin'
      on my back under the appletrees lookin' up at the stars.' Miry she jest
      walked off home and said nothin' to nobody,&mdash;it wa'n't her way to
      talk much about things; and, if it hedn't ben for Tom Beacon himself,
      nobody need 'a' known nothin' about it. Tom was a little fellow, you see,
      and 'mazin' good-natured, and one o' the sort that couldn't keep nothin'
      to himself; and so he let the cat out o' the bag himself. Wal, there
      didn't nobody think the worse o' Miry. When fellers find a gal won't take
      saace from no man, they kind o' respect her; and then fellers allers
      thinks ef it hed ben <i>them</i>, now, things 'd 'a' been different.
      That's jest what Jim Moss and Ike Bacon said: they said, why Tom Beacon
      was a fool not to know better how to get along with Miry,&mdash;<i>they</i>
      never had no trouble. The fun of it was, that Tom Beacon himself was more
      crazy after her than he was afore; and they say he made Miry a right
      up-and-down offer, and Miry she jest wouldn't have him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see, that went agin old Black Hoss John's idees: old Black Hoss
      was about as close as a nut and as contrairy as a pipperage-tree. You
      ought to 'a' seen him. Why, his face was all a perfect crisscross o'
      wrinkles. There wa'n't a spot where you could put a pin down that there
      wa'n't a wrinkle; and they used to say that he held on to every cent that
      went through his fingers till he'd pinched it into two. You couldn't say
      that his god was his belly, for he hedn't none, no more'n an old file:
      folks said that he'd starved himself till the moon'd shine through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Black Hoss was awfully grouty about Miry's refusin' Tom Beacon,
      'cause there was his houses and lots o' land in Boston. A drefful worldly
      old critter Black Hoss John was: he was like the rich fool in the gospel.
      Wal, he's dead and gone now, poor critter, and what good has it all done
      him? It's as the Scriptur' says, 'He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not
      who shall gather them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miry hed a pretty hard row to hoe with old Black Hoss John. She was up
      early and down late, and kep' every thing a goin'. She made the cheese and
      made the butter, and between spells she braided herself handsome straw
      bunnets, and fixed up her clothes; and somehow she worked it so when she
      sold her butter and cheese that there was somethin' for ribbins and
      flowers. You know the Scriptur' says, 'Can a maid forget her ornaments?'
      Wal, Miry didn't. I 'member I used to lead the singin' in them days, and
      Miry she used to sing counter, so we sot putty near together in the
      singers' seats; and I used to think Sunday mornin's when she come to
      meetin' in her white dress and her red cheeks, and her bunnet all tipped
      off with laylock, that 'twas for all the world jest like sunshine to have
      her come into the singers' seats. Them was the days that I didn't improve
      my privileges, boys,&rdquo; said Sam, sighing deeply. &ldquo;There was times that ef
      I'd a spoke, there's no knowin' what mightn't 'a' happened, 'cause, you
      see, boys, I was better lookin' in them days than I be now. Now you mind,
      boys, when you grow up, ef you get to waitin' on a nice gal, and you're
      'most a mind to speak up to her, don't you go and put it off, 'cause, ef
      you do, you may live to repent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see, from the time that Bill Elderkin come and took the academy,
      I could see plain enough that it was time for me to hang up my fiddle.
      Bill he used to set in the singers' seats, too, and he would have it that
      he sung tenor. He no more sung tenor than a skunk-blackbird, but he made
      b'lieve he did, jest to git next to Miry in the singers' seats. They used
      to set there in the seats a writin' backward and forward to each other
      till they tore out all the leaves of the hymn-books, and the singin'-books
      besides. Wal, I never thought that the house o' the Lord was jest the
      place to be courtin' in, and I used to get consid'able shocked at the way
      things went on atween 'em. Why, they'd be a writin' all sermon-time; and
      I've seen him a lookin' at her all through the long prayer in a way that
      wa'n't right, considerin' they was both professors of religion. But then
      the fact was, old Black Hoss John was to blame for it, 'cause he never let
      'em have no chance to hum. Ye see, old Black Hoss he was sot agin Elderkin
      'cause he was poor. You see, his mother, the old Widdah Elderkin, she was
      jest about the poorest, peakedest old body over to Sherburne, and went out
      to days' works; and Bill Elderkin he was all for books and larnin', and
      old Black Hoss John he thought it was just shiftlessness: but Miry she
      thought he was a genius; and she got it sot in her mind that he was goin'
      to be President o' the United States, or some sich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, old Black Hoss he wa'n't none too polite to Miry's beaux in gineral,
      but when Elderkin used to come to see her he was snarlier than a saw: he
      hadn't a good word for him noways; and he'd rake up the fire right before
      his face and eyes, and rattle about fastenin' up the windows, and tramp up
      to bed, and call down the chamber-stairs to Miry to go to bed, and was
      sort o' aggravatin' every way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ef folks wants to get a gal set on havin' a man, that 'ere's the way
      to go to work. Miry had a consid'able stiff will of her own; and, ef she
      didn't care about Tom Beacon before, she hated him now; and, if she liked
      Bill Elderkin before, she was clean gone over to him now. And so she took
      to 'goin' to the Wednesday-evenin' lecture, and the Friday-even-in'
      prayer-meetin', and the singin'-school, jest as regular as a clock, and so
      did he; and arterwards they allers walked home the longest way. Fathers
      may jest as well let their gals be courted in the house, peaceable,
      'cause, if they can't be courted there, they 'll find places where they
      can be: it's jest human natur'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, come fall, Elderkin he went to college up to Brunswick; and then I
      used to see the letters as regular up to the store every week, comin' in
      from Brunswick, and old Black Hoss John he see 'em too, and got a way of
      droppin' on 'em in his coat-pocket when he come up to the store, and folks
      used to say that the letters that went into his coat-pocket didn't get to
      Miry. Anyhow, Miry she says to me one day, says she, 'Sam, you're up round
      the post-office a good deal,' says she. 'I wish, if you see any letters
      for me, you'd jest bring 'em along.' I see right into it, and I told her
      to be sure I would; and so I used to have the carryin' of great thick
      letters every week. Wal, I was waitin' on Hepsy' along about them times,
      and so Miry and I kind o' sympathized. Hepsy was a pretty gal, and I
      thought it was all best as 'twas; any way, I knew I couldn't get Miry, and
      I could get Hepsy, and that made all the difference in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, that next winter old Black Hoss was took down with rheumatism, and I
      tell you if Miry didn't have a time on't! He wa'n't noways sweet-tempered
      when he was well; but come to be crooked up with the rheumatis' and kep'
      awake nights, it seemed as if he was determined there shouldn't nobody
      have no peace so long as he couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd get Miry up and down with him night after night a makin' her heat
      flannels and vinegar, and then he'd jaw and scold so that she was eenymost
      beat out. He wouldn't have nobody set up with him, though there was offers
      made. No: he said Miry was his daughter, and 'twas her bisness to take
      care on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miry was clear worked down: folks kind o' pitied her. She was a strong
      gal, but there's things that wears out the strongest. The worst on't was,
      it hung on so. Old Black Hoss had a most amazin' sight o' constitution.
      He'd go all down to death's door, and seem hardly to have the breath o'
      life in him, and then up he'd come agin! These 'ere old folks that nobody
      wants to have live allers hev such a sight o' wear in 'em, they jest last
      and last; and it really did seem as if he'd wear Miry out and get her into
      the grave fust, for she got a cough with bein' up so much in the cold, and
      grew thin as a shadder. 'Member one time I went up there to offer to watch
      jest in the spring o' the year, when the laylocks was jest a buddin' out,
      and Miry she come and talked with me over the fence; and the poor gal she
      fairly broke down, and sobbed as if her heart would break, a tellin' me
      her trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, it reelly affected me more to have Miry give up so than most gals,
      'cause she'd allers held her head up, and hed sich a sight o' grit and
      resolution; but she told me all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems old Black Hoss he wa'n't content with worryin' on her, and
      gettin' on her up nights, but he kep' a hectorin' her about Bill Elderkin,
      and wantin' on her to promise that she wouldn't hev Bill when he was dead
      and gone; and Miry she wouldn't promise, and then the old man said she
      shouldn't have a cent from him if she didn't, and so they had it back and
      forth. Everybody in town was sayin' what a shame 'twas that he should
      sarve her so; for though he hed other children, they was married and gone,
      and there wa'n't none of them to do for him but jest Miry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, he hung on till jest as the pinys in the front yard was beginnin' to
      blow out, and then he began to feel he was a goin', and he sent for Parson
      Lothrop to know what was to be done about his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says Parson Lothrop, 'you must settle up all your worldly affairs;
      you must be in peace and love with all mankind; and, if you've wronged
      anybody, you must make it good to 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Black Hoss he bounced right over in his bed with his back to the
      minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The devil!' says he: ''twill take all I've got.' And he never spoke
      another word, though Parson Lothrop he prayed with him, and did what he
      could for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, that night I sot up with him; and he went off 'tween two and three
      in the mornin', and I laid him out regular. Of all the racks o' bone I
      ever see, I never see a human critter so poor as he was. 'Twa'n't nothin'
      but his awful will kep' his soul in his body so long, as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had the funeral in the meetin'-house a Sunday; and Parson Lothrop he
      preached a sarmon on contentment on the text, 'We brought nothin' into the
      world, and it's sartin we can carry nothin' out; and having food and
      raiment, let us be therewith content.' Parson Lothrop he got round the
      subject about as handsome as he could: he didn't say what a skinflint old
      Black Hoss was, but he talked in a gineral way about the vanity o'
      worryin' an' scrapin to heap up riches. Ye see, Parson Lothrop he could
      say it all putty easy, too, 'cause since he married a rich wife he never
      hed no occasion to worry about temporal matters. Folks allers preaches
      better on the vanity o' riches when they's in tol'able easy circumstances.
      Ye see, when folks is pestered and worried to pay their bills, and don't
      know where the next dollar's to come from, it's a great temptation to be
      kind o' valooin' riches, and mebbe envyin' those that's got 'em; whereas
      when one's accounts all pays themselves, and the money comes jest when its
      wanted regular, a body feels sort o' composed like, and able to take the
      right view o' things, like Parson Lothrop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, arter sermon the relations all went over to the old house to hear
      the will read; and, as I was kind o' friend with the family, I jest
      slipped in along with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire Jones he had the will; and so when they all got sot round all
      solemn, he broke the seals and unfolded it, cracklin' it a good while
      afore he begun and it was so still you might a heard a pin drop when he
      begun to read. Fust, there was the farm and stock, he left to his son John
      Brown over in Sherburne. Then there was the household stuff and all them
      things, spoons and dishes, and beds and kiver-lids, and so on, to his
      da'ter Polly Blanchard. And then, last of all, he says, he left to his
      da'ter Miry <i>the pitcher that was on the top o' the shelf in his
      bed-room closet.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That' 'are was an old cracked pitcher that Miry allers hed hated the
      sight of, and spring and fall she used to beg her father to let her throw
      it away; but no, he wouldn't let her touch it, and so it stood gatherin'
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some on 'em run and handed it down; and it seemed jest full o'
      scourin'-sand and nothin' else, and they handed it to Miry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Miry she was wrathy then. She didn't so much mind bein' left out in
      the will, 'cause she expected that; but to have that 'are old pitcher
      poked at her so sort o' scornful was more'n she could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She took it and gin it a throw across the room with all her might; and it
      hit agin the wall and broke into a thousand bits, when out rolled hundreds
      of gold pieces; great gold eagles and guineas flew round the kitchen jest
      as thick as dandelions in a meadow. I tell you, she scrabbled them up
      pretty quick, and we all helped her.

      right and proper she should. Miry she was a sensible gal, and she invested
      her money well; and so, when Bill Elderkin got through his law-studies, he
      found a wife that could make a nice beginnin' with him. And that's the
      way, you see, they came to be doin' as well as they be.

      OW, Sam, tell us certain true, is there any such things as ghosts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be there ghosts?&rdquo; said Sam, immediately translating into his vernacular
      grammar: &ldquo;wal, now, that are's jest the question, ye see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, grandma thinks there are, and Aunt Lois thinks it's all nonsense.
      Why, Aunt Lois don't even believe the stories in Cotton Mather's
      'Magnalia.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanter know?&rdquo; said Sam, with a tone of slow, languid meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were sitting on a bank of the Charles River, fishing. The soft
      melancholy red of evening was fading off in streaks on the glassy water,
      and the houses of Oldtown were beginning to loom through the gloom, solemn
      and ghostly. There are times and tones and moods of nature that make all
      the vulgar, daily real seem shadowy, vague, and supernatural, as if the
      outlines of this hard material present were fading into the invisible and
      unknown. So Oldtown, with its elm-trees, its great square white houses,
      its meeting-house and tavern and blacksmith's shop and mill, which at high
      noon seem as real and as commonplace as possible, at this hour of the
      evening were dreamy and solemn. They rose up blurred, indistinct, dark;
      here and there winking candles sent long lines of light through the
      shadows, and little drops of unforeseen rain rippled the sheeny darkness
      of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see, boys, in them things it's jest as well to mind your granny.
      There's a consid'able sight o' gumption in grandmas. You look at the folks
      that's allus tellin' you what they don't believe,&mdash;they don't believe
      this, and they don't believe that,&mdash;and what sort o' folks is they?
      Why, like yer Aunt Lois, sort o' stringy and dry. There ain't no 'sorption
      got out o' not believin' nothin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord a massy! we don't know nothin' 'bout them things. We hain't ben
      there, and can't say that there ain't no ghosts and sich; can we, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We agreed to that fact, and sat a little closer to Sam in the gathering
      gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about the Cap'n Brown house, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye didn't never go over the Cap'n Brown house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, we had not that advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, yer see, Cap'n Brown he made all his money to sea, in furrin parts,
      and then come here to Oldtown to settle down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there ain't no knowin' 'bout these 'ere old ship-masters, where
      they's ben, or what they's ben a doin', or how they got their money. Ask
      me no questions, and I 'll tell ye no lies, is 'bout the best philosophy
      for them. Wal, it didn't do no good to ask Cap'n Brown questions too
      close, 'cause you didn't git no satisfaction. Nobody rightly knew 'bout
      who his folks was, or where they come from; and, ef a body asked him, he
      used to say that the very fust he know'd 'bout himself he was a young man
      walkin' the streets in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, yer see, boys, he hed money, and that is about all folks wanter know
      when a man comes to settle down. And he bought that 'are place, and built
      that 'are house. He built it all sea-cap'n fashion, so's to feel as much
      at home as he could. The parlor was like a ship's cabin. The table and
      chairs was fastened down to the floor, and the closets was made with holes
      to set the casters and the decanters and bottles in, jest's they be at
      sea; and there was stanchions to hold on by; and they say that blowy
      nights the cap'n used to fire up pretty well with his grog, till he hed
      about all he could carry, and then he'd set and hold on, and hear the wind
      blow, and kind o' feel out to sea right there to hum. There wasn't no Mis'
      Cap'n Brown, and there didn't seem likely to be none. And whether there
      ever hed been one, nobody know'd. He hed an old black Guinea nigger-woman,
      named Quassia, that did his work. She was shaped pretty much like one o'
      these 'ere great crookneck-squashes. She wa'n't no gret beauty, I can tell
      you; and she used to wear a gret red turban and a yaller short gown and
      red petticoat, and a gret string o' gold beads round her neck, and gret
      big gold hoops in her ears, made right in the middle o' Africa among the
      heathen there. For all she was black, she thought a heap o' herself, and
      was consid'able sort o' predominative over the cap'n. Lordy massy! boys,
      it's alius so. Get a man and a woman together,&mdash;any sort o' woman
      you're a mind to, don't care who 'tis,&mdash;? and one way or another she
      gets the rule over him, and he jest has to train to her fife. Some does it
      one way, and some does it another; some does it by jawin', and some does
      it by 'kissin', and some does it by faculty and contrivance; but one way
      or another they allers does it. Old Cap'n Brown was a good stout, stocky
      kind o' John Bull sort o' fellow, and a good judge o' sperits, and allers
      kep' the best in them are cupboards o' his'n; but, fust and last, things
      in his house went pretty much as old Quassia said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks got to kind o' respectin' Quassia. She come to meetin' Sunday
      regular, and sot all fixed up in red and yaller and green, with glass
      beads and what not, lookin' for all the world like one o' them ugly Indian
      idols; but she was well-behaved as any Christian. She was a master hand at
      cookin'. Her bread and biscuits couldn't be beat, and no couldn't her
      pies, and there wa'n't no such pound-cake as she made nowhere. Wal, this
      'ere story I'm a goin' to tell you was told me by Cinthy Pendleton. There
      ain't a more respectable gal, old or young, than Cinthy nowheres. She
      lives over to Sherburne now, and I hear tell she's sot up a manty-makin'
      business; but then she used to do tailorin' in Oldtown. She was a member
      o' the church, and a good Christian as ever was. Wal, ye see, Quassia she
      got Cinthy to come up and spend a week to the Cap'n Brown house, a doin'
      tailorin' and a fixin' over his close: 'twas along toward the fust o'
      March. Cinthy she sot by the fire in the front' parlor with her goose and
      her press-board and her work: for there wa'n't no company callin', and the
      snow was drifted four feet deep right across the front door; so there
      wa'n't much danger o' any body comin' in. And the cap'n he was a perlite
      man to wimmen; and Cinthy she liked it jest as well not to have company,
      'cause the cap'n he'd make himself entertainin' tellin' on her
      sea-stories, and all about his adventures among the Ammonites, and
      Perresites, and Jebusites, and all sorts o' heathen people he'd been
      among.

      &ldquo;Wal, that 'are week there come on the master snow-storm. Of all the
      snow-storms that hed ben, that 'are was the beater; and I tell you the
      wind blew as if 'twas the last chance it was ever goin' to hev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, it's kind o' scary like to be shet up in a lone house with all
      natur' a kind o' breakin' out, and goin' on so, and the snow a comin' down
      so thick ye can't see 'cross the street, and the wind a pipin' and a
      squeelin' and a rumblin' and a tumblin' fust down this chimney and then
      down that. I tell you, it sort o' sets a feller thinkin' o' the three
      great things,&mdash;death, judgment, and etarnaty; and I don't care who
      the folks is, nor how good they be, there's times when they must be
      feelin' putty consid'able solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cinthy she said she kind o' felt so along, and she hed a sort o'
      queer feelin' come over her as if there was somebody or somethin' round
      the house more'n appeared. She said she sort o' felt it in the air; but it
      seemed to her silly, and she tried to get over it. But two or three times,
      she said, when it got to be dusk, she felt somebody go by her up the
      stairs. The front entry wa'n't very light in the daytime, and in the
      storm, come five o'clock, it was so dark that all you could see was jest a
      gleam o' somethin', and two or three times when she started to go up
      stairs she see a soft white suthin' that seemed goin' up before her, and
      she stopped with her heart a beatin' like a trip-hammer, and she sort o'
      saw it go up and along the entry to the cap'n's door, and then it seemed
      to go right through, 'cause the door didn't open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cinthy says she to old Quassia, says she, 'Is there anybody lives in
      this house but us?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Anybody lives here?' says Quassia: 'what you mean?' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Says Ointhy, 'I thought somebody went past me on the stairs last night
      and to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy! how old Quassia did screech and laugh. 'Good Lord!' says
      she, 'how foolish white folks is! Somebody went past you? Was 't the
      capt'in?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, it wa'n't the cap'n,' says she: 'it was somethin' soft and white,
      and moved very still; it was like somethin' in the air,' says she. Then
      Quassia she haw-hawed louder. Says she, 'It's hy-sterikes, Miss Cinthy;
      that's all it is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cinthy she was kind o ' 'shamed, but for all that she couldn't help
      herself. Sometimes evenin's she'd be a settin' with the cap'n, and she'd
      think she'd hear somebody a movin' in his room overhead; and she knowed it
      wa'n't Quassia, 'cause Quassia was ironin' in the kitchen. She took pains
      once or twice to find out that 'are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, the cap'n's room was the gret front upper chamber over the
      parlor, and then right oppi-site to it was the gret spare chamber where
      Cinthy slept. It was jest as grand as could be, with a gret four-post
      mahogany bedstead and damask curtains brought over from England; but it
      was cold enough to freeze a white bear solid,&mdash;the way spare chambers
      allers is. Then there was the entry between, run straight through the
      house: one side was old Quassia's room, and the other was a sort o'
      storeroom, where the old cap'n kep' all sorts o' traps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cinthy she kep' a hevin' things happen and a seein' things, till she
      didn't railly know what was in it. Once when she come into the parlor jest
      at sundown, she was sure she see a white figure a vanishin' out o' the
      door that went towards the side entry. She said it was so dusk, that all
      she could see was jest this white figure, and it jest went out still as a
      cat as she come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cinthy didn't like to speak to the cap'n about it. She was a close
      woman, putty prudent, Cinthy was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one night, 'bout the middle o' the week, this 'ere thing kind o' come
      to a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cinthy said she'd ben up putty late a sewin' and a finishin' off down in
      the parlor; and the cap'n he sot up with her, and was consid'able cheerful
      and entertainin', tellin' her all about things over in the Bermudys, and
      off to Chiny and Japan, and round the world ginerally. The storm that hed
      been a blowin' all the week was about as furious as ever; and the cap'n he
      stirred up a mess o' flip, and hed it for her hot to go to bed on. He was
      a good-natured critter, and allers had feelin's for lone women; and I
      s'pose he knew 'twas sort o' desolate for Cinthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, takin' the flip so right the last thing afore goin' to bed, she went
      right off to sleep as sound as a nut, and slep' on till somewhere about
      mornin', when she said somethin' waked her broad awake in a minute. Her
      eyes flew wide open like a spring, and the storm hed gone down and the
      moon come out; and there, standin' right in the moonlight by her bed, was
      a woman jest as white as a sheet, with black hair bangin' down to her
      waist, and the brightest, mourn fullest black eyes you ever see. She stood
      there lookin' right at Cinthy; and Cinthy thinks that was what waked her
      up; 'cause, you know, ef anybody stands and looks steady at folks asleep
      it's apt to wake 'em.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0175.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any way, Cinthy said she felt jest as ef she was turnin' to stone. She
      couldn't move nor speak. She lay a minute, and then she shut her eyes, and
      begun to say her prayers; and a minute after she opened 'em, and it was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cinthy was a sensible gal, and one that allers hed her thoughts about
      her; and she jest got up and put a shawl round her shoulders, and went
      first and looked at the doors, and they was both on 'em locked jest as she
      left 'em when she went to bed. Then she looked under the bed and in the
      closet, and felt all round the room: where she couldn't see she felt her
      way, and there wa'n't nothin' there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, next mornin' Cinthy got up and went home, and she kep' it to herself
      a good while. Finally, one day when she was workin' to our house she told
      Hepsy about it, and Hepsy she told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sam,&rdquo; we said, after a pause, in which we heard only the rustle of
      leaves and the ticking of branches against each other, &ldquo;what do you
      suppose it was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, there 'tis: you know jest as much about it as I do. Hepsy told
      Cinthy it might 'a' ben a dream; so it might, but Cinthy she was sure it
      wa'n't a dream, 'cause she remembers plain hearin' the old clock on the
      stairs strike four while she had her eyes open lookin' at the woman; and
      then she only shet 'em a minute, jest to say 'Now I lay me,' and opened
      'em and she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cinthy told Hepsy, and Hepsy she kep' it putty close. She didn't
      tell it to nobody except Aunt Sally Dickerson and the Widder Bije Smith
      and your Grandma Badger and the minister's wife; and they every one o' 'em
      'greed it ought to be kep' close, 'cause it would make talk. Wal, come
      spring somehow or other it seemed to 'a' got all over Old town. I heard
      on't to the store and up to the tavern; and Jake Marshall he says to me
      one day, 'What's this 'ere about the cap'n's house?' And the Widder Loker
      she says to me, 'There's ben a ghost seen in the cap'n's house;' and I
      heard on 't clear over to Needham and Sherburne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some o' the women they drew themselves up putty stiff and proper. Your
      Aunt Lois was one on 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ghost,' says she; 'don't tell me! Perhaps it would be best ef 'twas a
      ghost,' says she. She didn't think there ought to be no sich doin's in
      nobody's house; and your grandma she shet her up, and told her she didn't
      oughter talk so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk how?&rdquo; said I, interrupting Sam with wonder. &ldquo;What did Aunt Lois
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; said Sam mysteriously, &ldquo;there allers is folks in every
      town that's jest like the Sadducees in old times: they won't believe in
      angel nor sperit, no way you can fix it; and ef things is seen and done in
      a house, why, they say, it's 'cause there's somebody there; there's some
      sort o' deviltry or trick about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the story got round that there was a woman kep' private in Cap'n
      Brown's house, and that he brought her from furrin parts; and it growed
      and growed, till there was all sorts o' ways o' tellin on 't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some said they'd seen her a settin' at an open winder. Some said that
      moonlight nights they'd seen her a walkin' out in the back garden kind o'
      in and out 'mong the bean-poles and squash-vines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it come on spring and summer; and the winders o' the Cap'n Brown
      house stood open, and folks was all a watchin' on 'em day and night. Aunt
      Sally Dickerson told the minister's wife that she'd seen in plain daylight
      a woman a settin' at the chamber winder atween four and five o'clock in
      the mornin',&mdash;jist a settin' a lookin' out and a doin' nothin', like
      anybody else. She was very white and pale, and had black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some said that it was a nun the cap'n had brought away from a Roman
      Catholic convent in Spain, and some said he'd got her out o' the
      Inquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Sally said she thought the minister ought to call and inquire why
      she didn't come to meetin', and who she was, and all about her: 'cause,
      you see, she said it might be all right enough ef folks only know'd jest
      how things was; but ef they didn't, why, folks will talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did the minister do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Parson Lothrop? Wal, no, he didn't. He made a call on the cap'n in
      a regular way, and asked arter his health and all his family. But the
      cap'n he seemed jest as jolly and chipper as a spring robin, and he gin'
      the minister some o' his old Jamaiky; and the minister he come away and
      said he didn't see nothin'; and no he didn't. Folks&mdash;-never does see
      nothin' when they aint' lookin' where 'tis. Fact is, Parson Lothrop wa'n't
      fond o' interferin'; he was a master hand to slick things over. Your
      grandma she used to mourn about it, 'cause she said he never gin no p'int
      to the doctrines; but 'twas all of a piece, he kind o' took every thing
      the smooth way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your grandma she believed in the ghost, and so did Lady Lothrop. I
      was up to her house t'other day fixin' a door-knob, and says she, 'Sam
      your wife told me a strange story about the Cap'n Brown house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, ma'am, she did,' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, what do you think of it?' says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, sometimes I think, and then agin I don't know,' says I. 'There's
      Cinthy she's a member o' the church and a good pious gal,' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, Sam,' says Lady Lothrop, says she; 'and Sam,' says she, 'it is jest
      like something that happened once to my grandmother when she was livin' in
      the old Province House in Bostin.' Says she, 'These 'ere things is the
      mysteries of Providence, and it's jest as well not to have 'em too much
      talked about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Jest so,' says I,&mdash;'jest so. That 'are's what every woman I've
      talked with says; and I guess, fust and last, I've talked with twenty,&mdash;good,
      safe church-members,&mdash;and they's every one o' opinion that this 'ere
      oughtn't to be talked about. Why, over to the deakin's t'other night we
      went it all over as much as two or three hours, and we concluded that the
      best way was to keep quite still about it; and that's jest what they say
      over to Needham and Sherburne. I've been all round a hushin' this 'ere up,
      and I hain't found but a few people that hedn't the particulars one way or
      another.' This 'ere was what I says to Lady Lothrop. The fact was, I never
      did see no report spread so, nor make sich sort o' sarchin's o' heart, as
      this 'ere. It railly did beat all; 'cause, ef 'twas a ghost, why there was
      the p'int proved, ye see. Cinthy's a church-member, and she <i>see</i> it,
      and got right up and sarched the room: but then agin, ef 'twas a woman,
      why that 'are was kind o' awful; it give cause, ye see, for thinkin' all
      sorts o' things. There was Cap'n Brown, to be sure, he wa'n't a
      church-member; but yet he was as honest and regular a man as any goin', as
      fur as any on us could see. To be sure, nobody know'd where he come from,
      but that wa'n't no reason agin' him: this 'ere might a ben a crazy sister,
      or some poor critter that he took out o' the best o' motives; and the
      Scriptur' says, 'Charity hopeth all things.' But then, ye see, folks will
      talk,&mdash;that 'are's the pester o' all these things,&mdash;and they did
      some on 'em talk consid'able strong about the cap'n; but somehow or other,
      there didn't nobody come to the p'int o' facin' on him down, and sayin'
      square out, 'Cap'n Brown, have you got a woman in your house, or hain't
      you? or is it a ghost, or what is it?' Folks somehow never does come to
      that. Ye see, there was the cap'n so respectable, a settin' up every
      Sunday there in his pew, with his ruffles round his hands and his red
      broadcloth cloak and his cocked hat. Why, folks' hearts sort o' failed 'em
      when it come to sayin' any thing right to him. They thought and kind o'
      whispered round that the minister or the deakins oughter do it: but Lordy
      massy! ministers, I s'pose, has feelin's like the rest on us; they don't
      want to eat all the hard cheeses that nobody else won't eat. Anyhow, there
      wasn't nothin' said direct to the cap'n; and jest for want o' that all the
      folks in Oldtown kep' a bilin' and a bilin' like a kettle o' soap, till it
      seemed all the time as if they'd bile over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some o' the wimmen tried to get somethin' out o' Quassy. Lordy massy! you
      might as well 'a' tried to get it out an old tom-turkey, that 'll strut
      and gobble and quitter, and drag his wings on the ground, and fly at you,
      but won't say nothin'. Quassy she screeched her queer sort o' laugh; and
      she told 'em that they was a makin' fools o' themselves, and that the
      cap'n's matters wa'n't none o' their bisness; and that was true enough. As
      to goin' into Quassia's room, or into any o' the store-rooms or closets
      she kep' the keys of, you might as well hev gone into a lion's den. She
      kep' all her places locked up tight; and there was no gettin' at nothin'
      in the Cap'n Brown house, else I believe some o' the wim-men would 'a'
      sent a sarch-warrant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what came of it? Didn't anybody ever find out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;it come to an end sort o', and didn't come to an end. It
      was jest this 'ere way. You see, along in October, jest in the
      cider-makin' time, Abel Flint he was took down with dysentery and died.
      You 'member the Flint house: it stood on a little rise o' ground jest
      lookin' over towards the Brown house. Wal, there was Aunt Sally Dickerson
      and the Widder Bije Smith, they set up with the corpse. He was laid out in
      the back chamber, you see, over the milk-room and kitchen; but there was
      cold victuals and sich in the front chamber, where the watchers sot. Wal,
      now, Aunt Sally she told me that between three and four o'clock she heard
      wheels a rumblin', and she went to the winder, and it was clear starlight;
      and she see a coach come up to the Cap'n Brown house; and she see the
      cap'n come out bringin' a woman all wrapped in a cloak, and old Quassy
      came arter with her arms full o' bundles; and he put her into the
      kerridge, and shet her in, and it driv off; and she see old Quassy stand
      lookin' over the fence arter it. She tried to wake up the widder, but
      'twas towards mornin', and the widder allers was a hard sleeper; so there
      wa'n't no witness but her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, it wasn't a ghost,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;after all, and it <i>was</i> a
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, there 'tis, you see. Folks don't know that 'are yit, 'cause there
      it's jest as broad as 'tis long. Now, look at it. There's Cinthy, she's a
      good, pious gal: she locks her chamber-doors, both on 'em, and goes to
      bed, and wakes up in the night, and there's a woman there. She jest shets
      her eyes, and the woman's gone. She gits up and looks, and both doors is
      locked jest as she left 'em. That 'ere woman wa'n't flesh and blood now,
      no way,&mdash;not such flesh and blood as we knows on; but then they say
      Cinthy might hev dreamed it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, look at it t'other way. There's Aunt Sally Dickerson; she's a
      good woman and a church-member: wal, she sees a woman in a cloak with all
      her bundles brought out o' Cap'n Brown's house, and put into a kerridge,
      and driv off, atween three and four o'clock in the mornin'. Wal, that 'ere
      shows there must 'a' ben a real live woman kep' there privately, and so
      what Cinthy saw wasn't a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, Cinthy says Aunt Sally might 'a' dreamed it,&mdash;that she got
      her head so full o' stories about the Cap'n Brown house, and watched it
      till she got asleep, and hed this 'ere dream; and, as there didn't nobody
      else see it, it might 'a' ben, you know. Aunt Sally's clear she didn't
      dream, and then agin Cinthy's clear <i>she</i> didn't dream; but which on
      'em was awake, or which on 'em was asleep, is what ain't settled in
      Oldtown yet.&rdquo;

      ES, this 'ere's Tekawampait's grave,&rdquo; said Sam Lawson, sitting leisurely
      down on an ancient grass-grown mound, ornamented by a mossy black
      slate-stone slab, with a rudely-carved cherub head and wings on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was Tekawampait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanter know, now, if your granny hain't told you who Tekawampait was?&rdquo;
       said Sam, pushing back his torn straw hat, and leaning against the old
      slanting gravestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she never told us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, Tekawampait he was the fust Christian Indian minister o' the
      gospel there was in Old-town. He was a full-blooded Indian, but he was as
      good a Christian as there was goin'; and he was settled here over the
      church in Oldtown afore Parson Peabody; and Parson Peabody he come afore
      Parson Lothrop; and a very good minister Teka-wampait was too. Folks hes
      said that there couldn't nothin' be made o' Indians; that they was nothin'
      but sort o' bears and tigers a walkin' round on their hind legs, a seekin'
      whom they might devour; but Parson Eliot he didn't think so. 'Christ died
      for them as wal as for me,' says he; 'and jest give 'em the gospel,' says
      he, 'and the rest 'll come along o' itself.' And so he come here to
      Oldtown, and sot up a sort o' log-hut right on the spot where the old
      Cap'n Brown house is now. Them two great elm-trees that's a grown now each
      side o' the front gate was two little switches then, that two Indians
      brought up over their shoulders, and planted there for friendship trees,
      as they called 'em; and now look what trees they be! He used to stand
      under that 'are big oak there, and preach to the Indians, long before
      there was any meetin'-house to speak in here in Oldtown.

      &ldquo;Wal, now, I tell you, it took putty good courage in Parson Eliot to do
      that 'are. I tell you, in them days it took putty consid'able faith to see
      any thing in an Indian but jest a wild beast. Folks can't tell by seein'
      on 'em now days what they was in the old times when all the settlements
      was new, and the Indians was stark, starin' wild, a ravin' and tarin'
      round in the woods, and a fightin' each other and a fightin' the white
      folks. Lordy massy! the stories I've heard women tell in their
      chimbley-corners about the things that used to happen when they was little
      was enough to scare the very life out o' ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do, do tell us some of them!&rdquo; said Henry and I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy, boys: why, ye wouldn't sleep for a week. Why, ye don't know.
      Why, the Indians in them days wa'n't like no critter ye ever did see. They
      was jest the horridest, paintedest, screeehinest, cussedest critters you
      ever heard on. They was jest as artful as sarpents, and crueller than any
      tigers. Good Dr. Cotton Mather calls 'em divils, and he was a meek, good
      man, Dr. Cotton was; but they cut up so in his days, it's no wonder he
      thought they was divils, and not folks. Why, they kep' the whole country
      in a broil for years and years. Nobody knowed when they was safe; for they
      were so sly and cunnin', and always watchin' behind fences and bushes, and
      ready when a body was a least thinkin' on't to be down on 'em. I've heard
      Abiel Jones tell how his father's house was burnt down at the time the
      Indians burnt Deerfield. About every house in the settlement was burnt to
      the ground; and then another time they burnt thirty-two houses in
      Springfield,&mdash;the minister's house and all, with all his library (and
      books was sca'ce in them days); but the Indians made a clean sweep on't.
      They burnt all the houses in Wendham down to the ground; and they came
      down in Lancaster, and burnt ever so many houses, and carried off forty or
      fifty people with 'em into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was Mr. Rolandson, the minister, they burnt his house, and carried
      off Mis' Rolandson and all the children. There was Jerushy Pierce used to
      work in his family and do washin' and chores, she's told me about it.
      Jerushy she was away to her uncle's that night, so she wa'n't took. Ye
      see, the Lancaster folks had been afeard the Indians'd be down on 'em, and
      so Parson Rolandson he'd gone on to Boston to get help for 'em; and when
      he come back the mischief was all done. Jerushy said in all her life she
      never see nothin' so pitiful as that 'are poor man's face when she met
      him, jest as he come to the place where the house stood. At fust he didn't
      say a word, she said, but he looked kind o' dazed. Then he sort o' put his
      hand to his forehead, and says he, 'My God, my God, help me!' Then he
      tried to ask her about it, but he couldn't but jest speak. 'Jerushy,' says
      he, 'can't you tell me,&mdash;where be they?' 'Wal,' says Jerushy,
      'they've been carried off.' And with that he fell right down and moaned
      and groaned. 'Oh!' says he, I'd rather heard that they were at peace with
      the Lord.' And then he'd wring his hands: 'What shall I do? What shall I
      do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, 'twa'n't long after this that the Indians was down on Medford, and
      burnt half the houses in town, and killed fifty or sixty people there.
      Then they came down on Northampton, but got driv' back; but then they
      burnt up five houses, and killed four or five of the folks afore they got
      the better of 'em there. Then they burnt all the houses in Groton,
      meetin'-house and all; and the pisen critters they hollared and triumphed
      over the people, and called out to 'em, 'What will you do for a house to
      pray in now? we've burnt your meetin'-house.' The fightin' was goin' on
      all over the country at the same time. The Indians set Marlborough afire,
      and it was all blazin' at once, the same day that some others of 'em was
      down on Springfield, and the same day Cap'n Pierce, with forty-nine white
      men and twenty-six Christian Indians, got drawn into an ambush, and every
      one of 'em killed. Then a few days after this they burnt forty houses at
      Rehoboth, and a little while after they burnt thirty more at Providence.
      And then when good Cap'n Wadsworth went with seventy men to help the
      people in Sudbury, the Indians came pourin' round 'em in the woods like so
      many wolves, and killed all but four or five on 'em; and those poor
      fellows had better hev been killed, for the cruel critters jest tormented
      'em to death, and mocked and jeered at their screeches and screams like so
      many divils. Then they went and broke loose on Andover; and they was so
      cruel they couldn't even let the dumb critters alone. They cut out the
      tongues of oxen and cows, and left 'em bleedin', and some they fastened up
      in barns and burnt alive. There wa'n't no sort o' diviltry they wa'n't up
      to. Why, it got to be so in them days that folks couldn't go to bed in
      peace without startin' every time they turned over for fear o' the
      Indians. Ef they heard a noise in the night, or ef the wind squealed and
      howled, as the wind will, they'd think sure enough there was that horrid
      yell a comin' down chimbley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was Delily Severence; she says to me, speakin' about them times,
      says she, 'Why, Mr. Lawson, you've no idee! Why, that 'are screech,' says
      she, 'wa'n't like no other noise in heaven above, or earth beneath, or
      water under the earth,' says she. 'When it started ye out o' bed between
      two or three o'clock in the mornin', and all your children a cryin', and
      the Indians a screechin' and yellin' and a tossin' up firebrands, fust at
      one window and then at another, why,' says she, 'Mr. Lawson, it was more
      like hell upon earth than any thing I ever heard on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, they come down on Delily's house when she was but jest up arter
      her third baby. That 'are woman hed a handsome head o' hair as ever ye
      see, black as a crow's wing; and it turned jest as white as a table-cloth,
      with nothin' but the fright o' that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did they do with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! they took her and her poor little gal and boy, that wa'n't no older
      than you be, and went off with 'em to Canada. The troubles them poor
      critters went through! Her husband he was away that night; and well he
      was, else they'd a tied him to a tree and stuck pine slivers into him and
      sot 'em afire, and cut gret pieces out'o his flesh, and filled the places
      with hot coals and ashes, and all sich kind o' things they did to them men
      prisoners, when they catched 'em. Delily was thankful enough he was away;
      but they took her and the children off through the ice and snow, jest half
      clothed and shiverin'; and when her baby cried and worried, as it
      nat'rally would, the old Indian jest took it by its heels, and dashed its
      brains out agin a tree, and threw it into the crotch of a tree, and left
      it dangling there; and then they would mock and laugh at her, and mimic
      her baby's crying, and try every way they could to aggravate her. They
      used to beat and torment her children right before her eyes, and pull
      their hair out, and make believe that they was goin' to burn 'em alive,
      jest for nothin' but to frighten and worry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;she ever got back alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the wimmen in them times hed a sight o' wear in 'em. They was
      resolute, strong, hard-workin' wimmen. They could all tackle a hoss, or
      load and fire a gun. They was brought up hard, and they was used to
      troubles and dangers. It's jest as folks gets used to things how they
      takes 'em. In them days folks was brought up to spect trouble; they didn't
      look for no less. Why, in them days the men allers took their guns into
      the field when they went to hoe corn, and took their guns with 'em to
      meetin' Sundays; and the wimmen they kep' a gun loaded where they knew
      where to find it; and when trouble come it was jest what they spected, and
      they was put even with it. That's the sort o' wimmen they was. Wal, Delily
      and her children was brought safe through at last, but they hed a hard
      time on't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us some more stories about Indians, Sam,&rdquo; we said, with the usual
      hungry impatience of boys for a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, let me see,&rdquo; said Sam, with his hat pushed back and his eyes fixed
      dreamily on the top of Eliot's oak, which was now yellow with the sunset
      glory,&mdash;&ldquo;let me see. I hain't never told ye about Col. Eph Miller,
      hev I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. What about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, he was took prisoner by the Indians; and they was goin' to roast him
      alive arter their fashion, and he gin 'em the slip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell us all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see, Deliverance Scranton over to Sherburne, she's Col. Eph's
      daughter; and she used to hear her father tell about that, and she's told
      me time and agin about it. It was this way,&mdash;You see, there hedn't
      ben no alarm about Indians for some time, and folks hed got to feelin'
      kind o' easy, as folks will. When there don't nothin' happen for a good
      while, and it keeps a goin' on so, why, you think finally there won't
      nothin' happen; and so it was with Col. Eph and his wife. She told
      Deliverance that the day before she reely hed forgot all about that there
      was any Indians in the country; and she'd been out after spruce and
      wintergreen and hemlock, and got over her brass kettle to bile for beer;
      and the child'n they brought in lots o' wild grapes that they gathered out
      in the woods; and they said when they came home that they thought they see
      an Indian a lyin' all along squirmin' through the bushes, and peekin' out
      at 'em like a snake, but they wa'n't quite sure. Faith, the oldest gal,
      she was sure she see him quite plain; but 'Bijah (he was Col. Eph's oldest
      boy) he wa'n't so sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, they didn't think no more about it, and that night they hed
      prayers and went off to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arterwards, Col. Eph he said he remembered the passage o' Scriptur' he
      read that night; it was, 'The race is not to the swift nor the battle to
      the strong.' He didn't notice it much when he read it; but he allers spoke
      of it arterwards as a remarkable providence that that 'are passage should
      have come jest so that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, atween twelve and one o'clock they was waked up by the most awful
      screechin' that ever you heard, as if twenty thousand devils was upon 'em.
      Mis' Miller she was out o' bed in a minit, all standin'. 'O husband,
      husband, the Indians are on us!' says she; and sure enough they was. The
      children, 'Bijah and Faith come a runnin' in. 'O father, father! what
      shall we do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Col. Eph was a man that allers knew in a minit what to do, and he kep'
      quite cool. 'My dear,' says he to his wife, 'you take the children, and
      jest run with 'em right out the buttery-door through the high corn, and
      run as fast as you can over to your father Stebbins', and tell him to
      rouse the town; and Bije,' says he to the boy, 'you jest get into the
      belfry window, and ring the bell with all your might,' says he. 'And I 'll
      stay and fight 'em off till the folks come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this while the Indians was a yellin' and screechin' and a wavin'
      fire-brands front of the house. Col. Eph he stood a lookin' through a hole
      in the shutter and a sightin' his gun while he was a talkin'. He see that
      they'd been a pilin' up a great pile o' dry wood agin the door. But the
      fust Indian that came up to put fire to't was shot right down while he was
      a speakin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Mis' Miller and Faith and Bije wa'n't long a dressin', you may
      believe; and they jest put on dark cloaks, and they jest streaked it out
      through the buttery-door! There was thick pole-beans quite up to the
      buttery-door, and then a field o' high corn, so that they was hid, and the
      way they run wasn't slow, I tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Col. Eph he hed to stop so to load that they got the pile o' brush
      afire, though he shot down three or four on 'em, and that was some
      comfort. But the long and the short o' the matter was, that they driv the
      door in at last, and came a whoopin' and yellin' into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, they took Col. Eph, and then went search-in' round to find somebody
      else; but jest then the meetin'-house bell begun to ring, and that scart
      'em, and they took Col. Eph and made off with him. He hedn't but jest time
      to get into his clothes and get his shoes on, when they hurried him off.
      They didn't do nothin' to him jest then, you see, these Indians was so
      cur'ous. If a man made a good fight, and killed three or four on 'em afore
      they could take him, they sot great store by him, and called him a brave
      man. And so they was 'mazin' careful of Col. Eph, and treated him quite
      polite for Indians; but he knew the ways on 'em well enough to know what
      it was all for. They wanted a real brave man to burn alive and stick
      slivers into and torment, and Col. Eph was jest the pattern for 'em, and
      his fight-in' so brave made him all the better for what they wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, he was in hopes the town would be roused in time for some of 'em to
      come arter him; but the Indians got the start of 'em, and got 'way off in
      the woods afore people hed fairly come together and found out what the
      matter was. There was Col. Eph's house a blazin' and a lightin' up all the
      country for miles round; and the colonel he said it come ruther hard on
      him to be lighted on his way through the woods by such a bonfire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, by mornin' they come to one o' their camps, and there they hed a
      great rejoicin' over him. They was going to hev a great feast, and a good
      time a burnin' on him; and they tied him to a tree, and sot an Indian to
      watch him while they went out to cut pine knots and slivers to do him
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, as I said, Col. Eph was a brave man, and a man that always kep' his
      thoughts about him; and so he kep' a workin' and a workin' with the withs
      that was round his hands, and a prayin' in his heart to the Lord, till he
      got his right hand free. Wal, he didn't make no move, but kep' a loosenin'
      and a loosenin' little by little, keepin' his eye on the Indian who sot
      there on the ground by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Col. Eph hed slipped his feet into his Sunday shoes that stood there
      by the bed and hed great silver shoe-buckles; and there was a providence
      in his doin' so, for, ye see, Indians are 'mazin' fond o' shiny things.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0203.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the old Indian he was took with the shine o' these shoe-buckles, and
      he thought he might as well hev 'em as anybody; so he jest laid down his
      tommyhawk, and got down on his knees, and was workin' away as earnest as
      could be to get off the buckles, and Col. Eph he jest made a dart forward
      and picked up the tommyhawk, and split open the Indian's skull with one
      blow: then he cut the withs that was round his legs, and in a minute he
      was off on the run with the tommyhawk in his hand. There was three Indians
      give chase to him, but Col. Eph he kep' ahead of 'em. He said while he was
      a runnin' he was cryin,' and callin' on the Lord with all his might, and
      the words come into his mind he read at prayers the night afore, 'The race
      is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last he see the Indians gained on him; and he faced round suddenly,
      and struck the nighest one smack on the head with his tommyhawk. Then when
      the next one come up he cut him down too; and the third one, when he see
      both the others cut down, and Col. Eph comin' full blaze towards him with
      his tommyhawk a swingin', he jest turned and run for dear life. Then Col.
      Eph he turned and cut for the settlement. He run, and he run, and he run,
      he didn't well know how long, till, finally, he was clear tuckered out,
      and he jest dropped down under a tree and slept; and he lay there all the
      rest of that day, and all night, and never woke till the next day about
      sundown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he woke up, and found he was close by home, and John Stebbins, his
      wife's father, and a whole party, was out lookin' for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Col. Eph used to tell the story as long as he lived, and the tears
      used to run down his cheeks when he told it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There's a providence in every thing,' he used to say, 'even down to
      shoe-buckles. Ef my Sunday shoes hadn't happened to 'a' set there so I
      could 'a' slipped into 'em, I couldn't 'a' killed that Indian, and I
      shouldn't 'a' been here to-day.' Wal, boys, he was in the right on't. Some
      seem to think the Lord don't look out only for gret things, but, ye see,
      little things is kind o' hinges that gret ones turns on. They say, take
      care o' pennies, and dollars 'll take care o' themselves. It's jest so in
      every thing; and, ef the Lord don't look arter little things, he ain't so
      gret as they say, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, wal,&rdquo; said Sam in conclusion, &ldquo;now, who'd 'a' thought that anybody
      could 'a' made any thing out o' Indians? Yet there 'twas. All them Martha
      Vineyard Indians turned Christians, and there was Indian preachers and
      Indian teachers; and they reely did settle down, and get to be quite like
      folks. But I tell you, boys, it took faith to start with.&rdquo;

      T was Saturday afternoon,&mdash;time of blessed memory to boys,&mdash;and
      we were free for a ramble after huckleberries; and, with our pails in
      hand, were making the best of our way to a noted spot where that fruit was
      most abundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sam was with us, his long legs striding over the ground at a rate that
      kept us on a brisk trot, though he himself was only lounging leisurely,
      with his usual air of contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look 'ere, boys,&rdquo; he suddenly said, pausing and resting his elbow on the
      top of a rail-fence, &ldquo;we shall jest hev to go back and go round by Deakin
      Blodgett's barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; we both burst forth in eager tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, don't ye see the deakin's turned in his bull into this 'ere lot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I ain't afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Harry. &ldquo;Look at him: he looks mild enough: he won't hurt
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as you knows on,&rdquo; said Sam; &ldquo;and then, agin, you don't know,&mdash;nobody
      never knows, what one o' them 'ere critters will do: they's jest the most

      sure to do t'other. I could tell ye a story now that'd jest make yer har
      stan' on eend.&rdquo; Of course we wanted to have our hair stand on end, and
      beset Sam for the story; but he hung off.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy! boys, jest let's wait till ye've got yer huckleberries: yer
      granny won't like it ef ye don't bring her none, and Hepsy she 'll be in
      my har,&mdash;what's left on't,&rdquo; said Sam, taking off his old torn hat,
      and rubbing the loose shock of brash and grizzled hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we turned and made a <i>détour</i>, leaving the bull on the right,
      though we longed amazingly to have a bout with him, for the fun of the
      thing, and mentally resolved to try it when our mentor was not round.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all comes back to me again,&mdash;the image of that
      huckleberry-pasture, interwoven with fragrance of sweet-fern, and the
      ground under our feet embroidered with star-moss and wintergreen, or foamy
      patches of mossy frost-work, that crushed and crackled delightfully
      beneath our feet. Every now and then a tall, straight fire-lily&mdash;black,
      spotted in its centre&mdash;rose like a little jet of flame; and we
      gathered it eagerly, though the fierce August sun wilted it in our hands.
      The huckleberry-bushes, bending under their purple weight, we gathered in
      large armfuls, and took them under the shadow of the pine-trees, that we
      might strip them at our leisure, without being scorched by the intense
      glare of the sun. Armful after armful we carried and deposited in the
      shade, and then sat down to the task of picking them off into our pails.
      It was one of those New-England days hotter than the tropics, Not a breath
      of air was stirring, not a bird sang a note, not a sound was heard, except
      the drowsy grating of the locusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, Sam, now tell us that story about the bull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy, how hot 'tis!&rdquo; said Sam, lying back, and resting on the
      roots of a tree, with his hands folded under his head. &ldquo;I'm all in a drip
      of sweat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sam, we 'll pick off your berries, if you 'll talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wall, wall, be kerful yer don't git no green ones in among 'em, else
      Hepsy 'll be down on me. She's drefful partikelar, she is. Every thing has
      to be jest so. Ef it ain't, you 'll hear on't. Lordy massy I boys, she's
      always telling me I don't do nothin' for the support of the family. I
      leave it to you if I didn't ketch her a nice mess o' fish a Tuesday. I
      tell her folks can't expect to roll in money, and allers to have every
      thing jess 'z they want it. We brought nothin' into the world with us, and
      it's sartain we ken carry nothin' out; and, having food and raiment, we
      ought to be content. We have ben better off'n we be now. Why, boys, I've
      seen the time that I've spent thirty-seven cents a week for nutmegs; but
      Hepsy hain't no gratitude: such folks hez to be brought down. Take care,
      now, yer ain't a-putting green ones in; be yer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam, we sha'n't put in any at all, if you don't tell us that story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy! you young ones, there ain't never no contentin' yer, ef a
      fellow was to talk to the millennium. Wonder now if there is going to be
      any millennium. Wish I'd waited, and been born in them days, 'spect things
      would a sorter come along easier. Wall, I shall git through some way, I
      s'pose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said I, sitting back, &ldquo;we're putting all our berries into your
      pail; and, if you don't begin to tell us a story, we won't do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy! boys, I'm kind o' collectin' my idees. Ye have to talk a
      while to git a-goin', everybody does. Wal, about this 'ere story. Ye
      'member that old brown house, up on the hill there, that we saw when we
      come round the corner? That 'are was where old Mump Moss used to live. Old
      Mump was consid'able of a nice man: he took in Ike Sanders, Mis' Moss's
      sister's boy, to help him on the farm, and did by him pretty much ez, he
      did by his own. Bill Moss, Mump's boy, he was a con-trairy kind o'
      critter, and he was allers a-hectorin' Ike. He was allers puttin' off the
      heaviest end of every thing on to him. He'd shirk his work, and git it off
      on to Ike every way he could. And he allers threw it up at him that he was
      eatin' his father's bread; and he watched every mouthful he ate, as if he
      hated to see it go down. Wal, ye see, for all that. Ike he growed up tall
      and strong, and a real handsome young feller; and everybody liked him. And
      Bill he was so gritty and contrairy, that his own mother and sisters
      couldn't stan' him; and he was allers a-flingin' it up at 'em that they
      liked Ike more'n they did him. Finally his mother she said to him one day,
      'Why shouldn't I,' sez she, 'when Ike's allers pleasant to me, and doin'
      every thing he ken fur me, and you don't do nothin' but scold.' That 'are,
      you see, was a kind o' home-thrust, and Bill he didn't like Ike a bit the
      better for that. He did every thing he could to plague him, and hector
      him, and sarcumvent him, and set people agin him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, 'twas the old story about Jacob and Laban over agin. Every
      thing that Ike put his hand to kind o' prospered. Everybody liked him,
      everybody hed a good word for him, everybody helped grease his wheels.
      Wal, come time when he was twenty-one, old Mump he gin him a settin' out.
      He gin him a freedom suit o' clothes, and he gin him a good cow, and Mis'
      Moss she knit him up a lot o' stockings, and the gals they made him up his
      shirts. Then, Ike he got a place with Squire Wells, and got good wages;
      and he bought a little bit o' land, with a house on it, on Squire Wells's
      place, and took a mortgage on't, to work off. He used to work his own
      land, late at night and early in the mornin', over and above givin' good
      days' works to the squire; and the old squire he sot all the world by him,
      and said he hedn't hed sich a man to work since he didn't know when.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, a body might ha' thought that when Bill had a got him out o' the
      house, he might ha' ben satisfied, but he wasn't. He was an ugly fellow,
      Bill Moss was; and a body would ha' thought that every thing good that
      happened to Ike was jest so much took from him. Come to be young men,
      growed up together, and waitin' on the gals round, Ike he was pretty apt
      to cut Bill out. Yer see, though Bill was goin' to have the farm, and all
      old Mump's money, he warn't pleasant-spoken; and so, when the gals got a
      chance, they'd allers rather go with Ike than him. Finally, there was
      Delily Sawin, she was about the handsomest girl there was round, and she
      hed all the fellers arter her; and her way was to speak 'em all fair, and
      keep 'em all sort o' waitin' and hopin', till she got ready to make her
      mind up. She'd entertain Bill Saturday night, and she'd tell Ike he might
      come Sunday night; and so Ike he was well pleased, and Bill he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, there come along a gret cattle-show. Squire Wells he got it up: it
      was to be the gretest kind of a time, and Squire Wells he give money fur
      prizes. There was to be a prize on the best cow, and the best bull, and
      the best ox, and the best horse, and the biggest punkins and squashes and
      beets, and there was a prize for the best loaf o' bread, and the best pair
      o' stockin's, and the handsomest bed-quilt, and the rest o' women's work.
      Wal, yer see, there was a gret to-do about the cattle-show; and the wagons
      they came in from all around,&mdash;ten miles; and the gals all dressed up
      in their best bunnits, and they had a ball in the evenin'. Wal, ye see, it
      so happened that Bill and Ike each on 'em sent a bull to the cattle-show;
      and Ike's bull took the prize. That put the cap-sheaf on for Bill. He was
      jest about as much riled as a feller could be; and that evenin' Delily she
      danced with Ike twice as many times ez she did with him. Wal, Bill he got
      it round among the fellers that the jedges hed been partial; and he said,
      if them bulls was put together, his bull would whip Ike's all to thunder.
      Wal, the fellers thought 'twould be kind o' fun to try 'em, and they put
      Ike up to it. And finally 'twas agreed that Ike's bull should be driv over
      to old Mump's; and the Monday after the cattle-show, they should let 'em
      out into the meadow together and see which was the strongest. So there was
      a Sunday the bulls they were both put up together in the same barn; and
      the 'greement was, they wasn't to be looked at nor touched till the time
      come to turn 'em out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come Sunday mornin', they got up the wagon to go to meetin'; and Mis'
      Moss and the gals and old Mump, they was all ready; and the old yaller dog
      he was standrn' waitin' by the wagon, and Bill warn't nowhere to be found.
      So they sent one o' the girls up chamber to see what'd got him; and there
      he was a-lyin' on the bed, and said he'd got a drefful headache, and
      didn't think he could go to meetin'. Wal, the second bell was a-tollin',
      and they had to drive off without him: they never mistrusted but what
      'twas jest so. Wal, yer see, boys, 'twas that 'are kind o' Sunday headache
      that sort o' gets better when the folks is all fairly into meetin'. So,
      when the wagon was fairly out o' sight, Bill he thought he'd jest go and
      have a peek at them bulls. Wal, he looked and he peeked, and finally he
      thought they looked so sort o' innocent 'twouldn't do no harm to jest let
      'em have a little run in the cow-yard aforehand. He kind o' wanted to see
      how they was likely to cut up. Now, ye see, the mischief about bulls is,
      that a body never knows what they's goin' to do, 'cause whatever notion
      takes 'em allers comes into their heads so kind o' suddin, and it's jest a
      word and a blow with 'em. Wal, fust he let out his bull, and then he went
      in and let out Ike's. Wal, the very fust thing that critter did he run up
      to Bill's bull, full tilt, and jest gin one rip with his horns right in
      the side of him, and knocked him over and killed him. Didn't die right
      off, but he was done for; and Bill he gin a the old feller turned right
      round, and come at <i>him</i>. I tell you, Bill he turned and made a
      straight coattail, rippin' and peelin' it towards the house, and the bull
      tearin' on right arter him. Into the kitchen he went, and he hedn't no
      time to shut the door, and the bull arter him; and into the keepin'-room,
      and the bull arter him there. And he hedn't but jest time to git up the
      chamber-stairs, when he heard the old feller roarin' and tearin' round
      there like all natur. Fust he went to the lookin'-glass, and smashed that
      all to pieces. Then he histed the table over, and he rattled and smashed
      the chairs round, and made such a roaring and noise, ye'd ha' thought
      there was seven devils there; and in the midst of it Bill he looked out of
      the window, and see the wagon a-comin' back; and 'Lordy massy!' he thought
      to himself, 'the bull 'll kill every one on 'em,' and he run to the window
      and yelled and shouted, and they saw him, and thought the house must be
      afire.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, he bethought him of old Mump's gun, and he run round and got it,
      and poked it through a crack of the chamber-door, and fired off bang! and
      shot him dead, jest as Mis' Moss and the girls was comin' into the
      kitchen-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, there was, to be sure, the 'bomination o' desolation when they come
      in and found every thing all up in a heap and broke to pieces, and the old
      critter a-kickin' and bleedin' all over the carpet, and Bill as pale as
      his shirt-tail on the chamber-stairs. They had an awful mess on't; and
      there was the two bulls dead and to be took care uv.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, Bill,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;'I hope yer satisfied now. All that comes
      o' stayin' to home from meetin', and keepin' temporal things in yer head
      all day Sunday. You've lost your own bull, you've got Ike's to pay for,
      and ye 'll have the laugh on yer all round the country.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I expect, father, we ken corn the meat,' says Mis' Moss, 'and maybe the
      hide 'll sell for something,' sez she; for she felt kind o' tender for
      Bill, and didn't want to bear down too hard on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the story got round, and everybody was a-throwin' it up at Bill; and
      Delily, in partikelar, hectored him about it till he wished the bulls had
      been in the Red Sea afore he'd ever seen one on 'em. Wal, it really driv
      him out o' town, and he went off out West to settle, and nobody missed him
      much; and Ike he married Delily, and they grew from better to better, till
      now they own jest about as pretty a farm as there is round. Yer remember
      that white house with green blinds, that we passed when we was goin' to
      the trout-brook? Wal, that 'ere's the one.&rdquo;

      OOK here, boys,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;don't you want to go with me up to the Devil's
      Den this arternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the Devil's Den,&rdquo; said I, with a little awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, it's a longer tramp than I've ever took ye. It's clear up past the
      pickerel pond, and beyond old Skunk John's pasture-lot. It's a 'mazin'
      good place for raspberries; shouldn't wonder if we should get two, three
      quarts there. Great rocks there higher'n yer head; kinder solemn, 'tis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a delightful and seductive account, and we arranged for a walk
      that very afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In almost every New-England village the personality of Satan has been
      acknowledged by calling by his name some particular rock or cave, or other
      natural object whose singularity would seem to suggest a more than mortal
      occupancy. &ldquo;The Devil's Punchbowl,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Devil's Wash-bowl,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Devil's
      Kettle,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Devil's Pulpit,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Devil's Den,&rdquo; have been
      designations that marked places or objects of some striking natural
      peculiarity. Often these are found in the midst of the most beautiful and
      romantic scenery, and the sinister name seems to have no effect in
      lessening its attractions. To me, the very idea of going to the Devil's
      Den was full of a pleasing horror. When a boy, I always lived in the
      shadowy edge of that line which divides spirit land from mortal life, and
      it was my delight to walk among its half lights and shadows. The old
      graveyard where, side by side, mouldered the remains of Indian sachems and
      the ancients of English blood, was my favorite haunt. I loved to sit on
      the graves while the evening mists arose from them, and to fancy cloudy
      forms waving and beckoning. To me, this spirit land was my only refuge
      from the dry details of a hard, prosaic life. The schoolroom&mdash;with
      its hard seats rudely fashioned from slabs of rough wood, with its clumsy
      desks, hacked and ink-stained, with its unintelligible textbooks and its
      unsympathetic teacher&mdash;was to me a prison out of whose weary windows
      I watched the pomp and glory of nature,&mdash;the free birds singing, the
      clouds sailing, the trees waving and whispering,&mdash;and longed, as
      earnestly as ever did the Psalmist, to flee far away, and wander in the
      wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, no joy of after life&mdash;nothing that the world has now to give&mdash;can
      equal that joyous sense of freedom and full possession which came over me
      on Saturday afternoons, when I started off on a tramp with the world all
      before me,&mdash;the mighty, unexplored world of mysteries and
      possibilities, bounded only by the horizon. Ignorant alike of all science,
      neither botanist nor naturalist, I was studying at firsthand all that lore
      out of which science is made. Every plant and flower had a familiar face
      to me, and said something to my imagination. I knew where each was to be
      found, its time of coming and going, and met them year after year as
      returning friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was with joyous freedom that we boys ram bled off with Sam this
      afternoon, intent to find the Devil's Den. It was a ledge of granite rocks
      rising in the midst of a grove of pines and white birches. The ground was
      yellow and slippery with the fallen needles of the pines of other days,
      and the glistening white stems of the birches shone through the shadows
      like ivory pillars. Underneath the great granite ledges, all sorts of
      roots and plants grappled and kept foothold; and whole armies of wild
      raspberries matured their fruit, rounder and juicier for growing in the
      shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one place yawned a great rift, or cavern, as if the rocks had been
      violently twisted and wrenched apart, and a mighty bowlder lodging in the
      rift had roofed it over, making a cavern of most seductive darkness and
      depth. This was the Devil's Den; and after we had picked our pail full of
      berries, we sat down there to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam, do you suppose the Devil ever was here?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What do they call
      this his den for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massy, child! that 'are was in old witch times. There used to be witch
      meetins' held here, and awful doins'; they used to have witch sabba' days
      and witch sacraments, and sell their souls to the old boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should they want to do that for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, sure enough; what was it for? I can't make out that the Devil ever
      gin 'em any thing, any on 'em. They warn't no richer, nor didn't get no
      more'n this world than the rest; and they was took and hung; and then ef
      they went to torment after that, they hed a pretty bad bargain on't, I
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, people don't do such things any more, do they?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Since the gret fuss and row-de-dow about it, it's kind o'
      died out; but there's those, I s'pose, that hez dealins' with the old boy.
      Folks du say that old Ketury was a witch, and that, ef't ben in old times,
      she'd a hed her neck stretched; but she lived and died in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you think,&rdquo; said I, now proposing the question that lay nearest my
      heart, &ldquo;that the Devil can hurt us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends consid'able on how you take him,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Ye see, come to
      a straight out-an'-out fight with him, he 'll git the better on yer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Christian did fight Apollyon, and got him down too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had no more doubt in those days that this was an historic fact than I
      had of the existence of Romulus and Remus and the wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, that 'ere warn't jest like real things: they say that 'ere's an
      allegory. But I 'll tell ye how old Sarah Bunganuck fit the Devil, when he
      'peared to her. Ye see, old Sarah she was one of the converted Injuns, and
      a good old critter she was too; worked hard, and got her livin' honest.
      She made baskets, and she made brooms, and she used to pick young
      wintergreen and tie it up in bunches, and dig sassafras and ginsing to
      make beer; and she got her a little bit o' land, right alongside o' Old
      Black Hoss John's white-birch wood-lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I've heerd some o' these 'ere modern ministers that come down from
      Cambridge college, and are larnt about every thing in creation, they say
      there ain't no devil, and the reason on't is, 'cause there can't be none.
      These 'ere fellers is so sort o' green!&mdash;they don't mean no harm, but
      they don't know nothin' about nobody that does. If they'd ha' known old
      Black Hoss John, they'd ha' been putty sure there was a devil. He was jest
      the crossest, ugliest critter that ever ye see, and he was ugly jest for
      the sake o' ugliness. He couldn't bear to let the boys pick huckleberries
      in his paster lots, when he didn't pick 'em himself; and he was allers
      jawin' me 'cause I would go trout-fishin' in one o' his pasters. Jest ez
      if the trout that swims warn't, the Lord's, and jest ez much mine as his.
      He grudged every critter every thing; and if he'd ha' hed his will and
      way, every bird would ha' fell down dead that picked up a worm on his
      grounds. He was jest as nippin' as a black frost. Old Black Hoss didn't
      git drunk in a regerlar way, like Uncle Eph and Toddy Whitney, and the
      rest o' them boys. But he jest sot at home, a-soakin' on cider, till he
      was crosser'n a bear with a sore head. Old Black Hoss hed a special spite
      agin old Sarah. He said she was an old witch and an old thief, and that
      she stole things off'n his grounds, when everybody knew that she was a
      regerlar church-member, and as decent an old critter as there was goin'.
      As to her stealin', she didn't do nothin' but pick huckleberries and
      grapes, and git chesnuts and wannuts, and butternuts, and them 'ere wild
      things that's the Lord's, grow on whose land they will, and is free to
      all. I've hearn 'em tell that, over in the old country, the poor was kept
      under so, that they couldn't shoot a bird, nor ketch a fish, nor gather no
      nuts, nor do nothin' to keep from starvin', 'cause the quality folks they
      thought they owned every thing, 'way-down to the middle of the earth and
      clear up to the stars. We never hed no sech doin's this side of the water,
      thank the Lord! We've allers been free to have the chesnuts and the
      wannuts and the grapes and the huckleberries and the strawberries, ef we
      could git 'em, and ketch fish when and where we was a mind to. Lordy
      massy! your grandthur's old Cesar, he used to call the pond his pork-pot.
      He'd jest go down and throw in a line and ketch his dinner. Wal, Old Black
      Hoss he know'd the law was so, and he couldn't do nothin' agin her by law;
      but he sarved her out every mean trick he could think of. He used to go
      and stan' and lean over her garden-gate and jaw at her an hour at a time;
      but old Sarah she had the Injun in her; she didn't run to talk much: she
      used to jest keep on with her weedin and her work, jest's if he warn't
      there, and that made Old Black Hoss madder'n ever; and he thought he'd try
      and frighten her off'n the ground, by makin' on her believe he was the
      Devil. So one time, when he'd been killin' a beef critter, they took off
      the skin with the horns and all on; and Old Black Hoss he says to Toddy
      and Eph and Loker, 'You jest come up tonight, and see how I 'll frighten
      old Sarah Bunganuck.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Toddy and Eph and Loker, they hedn't no better to do, and they
      thought they'd jest go round and see. Ye see 'twas a moonlight night, and
      old Sarah&mdash;she was an industrious critter&mdash;she was cuttin'
      white-birch brush for brooms in the paster-lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Old Black Hoss he wrapped the critter's skin round him, with the
      horns on his head, and come and stood by the fence, and begun to roar and
      make a noise.

      foolish, 'specially ez the fellers were waitin' to see how she took it. So
      he calls out in a grum voice,&mdash;

    <p>
      &ldquo;'Woman, don't yer know who I be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, I'm the Devil,' sez he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ye be?' says old Sarah. 'Poor old critter, how I pity ye!' and she never
      gin him another word, but jest bundled up her broom-stuff, and took it on
      her back and walked off, and Old Black Hoss he stood there mighty foolish
      with his skin and horns; and so he had the laugh agin him, 'cause Eph and
      Loker they went and told the story down to the tavern, and he felt awful
      cheap to think old Sarah had got the upper hands on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, ye see, boys, that 'ere's jest the way to fight the Devil. Jest keep
      straight on with what ye're doin', and don't ye mind him, and he can't do

    <p>
      E were in disgrace, we boys; and the reason of it was this: we had laughed
      out in meeting-time! To be sure, the occasion was a trying one, even to
      more disciplined nerves. Parson Lothrop had exchanged pulpits with Parson
      Summeral, of North Wearem. Now, Parson Summeral was a man in the very
      outset likely to provoke the risibles of unspiritualized juveniles. He was
      a thin, wiry, frisky little man, in a powdered white wig, black tights,
      and silk stockings, with bright knee-buckles and shoe-buckles; with round,
      dark, snapping eyes; and a curious, high, cracked, squeaking voice, the
      very first tones of which made all the children stare and giggle. The news
      that Parson Summeral was going to preach in our village spread abroad
      among us as a prelude to something funny. It had a flavor like the charm
      of circus-acting; and, on the Sunday morning of our story, we went to the
      house of God in a very hilarious state, all ready to set off in a laugh on
      the slightest provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion was not long wanting. Parson Lo-throp had a favorite dog
      yclept Trip, whose behavior in meeting was notoriously far from that
      edifying pattern which befits a minister's dog on Sundays. Trip was a
      nervous dog, and a dog that never could be taught to conceal his emotions
      or to respect conventionalities. If any thing about the performance in the
      singers' seat did not please him, he was apt to express himself in a
      lugubrious howl. If the sermon was longer than suited him, he would gape
      with such a loud creak of his jaws as would arouse everybody's attention.
      If the flies disturbed his afternoon's nap, he would give sudden snarls or
      snaps; or, if anything troubled his dreams, he would bark out in his sleep
      in a manner not only to dispel his own slumbers, but those of certain
      worthy deacons and old ladies, whose sanctuary repose was thereby sorely
      broken and troubled. For all these reasons, Madame Lo-throp had been
      forced, as a general thing, to deny Trip the usual sanctuary privileges of
      good family dogs in that age, and shut him up on Sundays to private
      meditation. Trip, of course, was only the more set on attendance, and
      would hide behind doors, jump out of windows, sneak through by-ways and
      alleys, and lie hid till the second bell had done tolling, when suddenly
      he would appear in the broad aisle, innocent and happy, and take his seat
      as composedly as any member of the congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine us youngsters on the <i>qui vive</i> with excitement at seeing
      Parson Summeral frisk up into the pulpit with all the vivacity of a black
      grasshopper. We looked at each other, and giggled very cautiously, with
      due respect to Aunt Lois's sharp observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, there was only a mild, quiet simmering of giggle, compressed
      decorously within the bounds of propriety; and we pursed our muscles up
      with stringent resolution, whenever we caught the apprehensive eye of our
      elders.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when, directly after the closing notes of the tolling second bell,
      Master Trip walked gravely up the front aisle, and, seating himself
      squarely in front of the pulpit, raised his nose with a critical air
      toward the scene of the forthcoming performance, it was too much for us:
      the repression was almost convulsive. Trip wore an alert, attentive air,
      befitting a sound, orthodox dog, who smells a possible heresy, and deems
      it his duty to watch the performances narrowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently he felt called upon to see who and what were to occupy that
      pulpit in his master's absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up rose Parson Summeral; and up went Trip's nose, vibrating with intense
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson began in his high-cracked voice to intone the hymn,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Sing to the Lord aloud,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      when Trip broke into a dismal howl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parson went on to give directions to the deacon, in the same voice in
      which he had been reading, so that the whole effect of the performance was
      somewhat as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;'Sing to the Lord aloud.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;(Please to turn out that dog),&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;'And make a joyful noise.,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog was turned out, and the choir did their best to make a joyful
      noise; but we boys were upset for the day, delivered over to the
      temptations of Satan, and plunged in waves and billows of hysterical
      giggle, from which neither winks nor frowns from Aunt Lois, nor the awful
      fear of the tithing-man, nor the comforting bits of fennel and orange-peel
      passed us by grandmother, could recover us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody felt, to be sure, that here was a trial that called for some
      indulgence. Hard faces, even among the stoniest saints, betrayed a
      transient quiver of the risible muscles; old ladies put up their fans;
      youths and maidens in the singers' seat laughed outright; and, for the
      moment, a general snicker among the children was pardoned. But I was one
      of that luckless kind, whose nerves, once set in vibration, could not be
      composed. When the reign of gravity and decorum had returned, Harry and I
      sat by each other, shaking with suppressed laughter. Every thing in the
      subsequent exercises took a funny turn; and in the long prayer, when
      everybody else was still and decorous, the whole scene came over me with
      such overpowering force, that I exploded with laughter, and had to be
      taken out of meeting and marched home by Aunt Lois, as a convicted
      criminal. What especially moved her indignation was, that, the more she
      rebuked and upbraided, the more I laughed, till the tears rolled down my
      cheeks; which Aunt Lois construed into wilful disrespect to her authority,
      and resented accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Sunday evening, as we gathered around the fire, the re-action from
      undue gayety to sobriety had taken place; and we were in a pensive and
      penitent state. Grandmother was gracious and forgiving; but Aunt Lois
      still preserved that frosty air of reprobation which she held to be a
      salutary means of quickening our consciences for the future. It was,
      therefore, with unusual delight that we saw our old friend Sam come in,
      and sit himself quietly down on the block in the chimney corner. With Sam
      we felt assured of indulgence and patronage; for, though always rigidly
      moral and instructive in his turn of mind, he had that fellow-feeling for
      transgressors which is characteristic of the loose-jointed, easy-going
      style of his individuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lordy massy, boys&mdash;yis,&rdquo; said Sam virtuously, in view of some of
      Aunt Lois's thrusts, &ldquo;ye ought never to laugh nor cut up in meetin'; that
      'are's so: but then there is times when the best on us gets took down. We
      gets took unawares, ye see,&mdash;even ministers does. Yis, natur' will
      git the upper hand afore they know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sam, <i>ministers</i> don't ever laugh in meetin'! do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We put the question with wide eyes. Such a supposition bordered on
      profanity, we thought: it was approaching the sin of Uzzah, who unwarily
      touched the ark of the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws, yes. Why, heven't you never heard how there was a council held to
      try Parson Morrel for laughin' out in prayer-time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laughing in prayer-time!&rdquo; we both repeated, with uplifted hands and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather's mild face became luminous with a suppressed smile, which
      brightened it as the moon does a cloud; but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said my grandmother, &ldquo;that affair did make a dreadful scandal
      in the time on't! But Parson Morrel was a good man; and I'm glad the
      council wasn't hard on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Sam Lawson, &ldquo;after all, it was more Ike Babbit's fault than
      'twas anybody's. Ye see, Ike he was allers for gettin' what he could out
      o' the town; and he would feed his sheep on the meetin'-house green.
      Somehow or other, Ike's fences allers contrived to give out, come Sunday,
      and up would come his sheep; and Ike was too pious to drive 'em back
      Sunday, and so there they was. He was talked to enough about it: 'cause,
      ye see, to hev sheep and lambs a ba-a-in' and a blatin' all prayer and
      sermon time wa'n't the thing. 'Member that 'are old meet-in'-house up to
      the North End, down under Blueberry Hill, the land sort o' sloped down, so
      as a body hed to come into the meetin'-house steppin' down instead o' up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact was, they said 'twas put there 'cause the land wa'n't good for
      nothin' else; and the folks thought puttin' a meetin'-house on't would be
      a clear savin'. But Parson Morrel he didn't like it, and was free to tell
      'em his mind on't,&mdash;that 'twas like bringin' the lame and the blind
      to the Lord's sarvice; but there 'twas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wa'n't a better minister, nor no one more set by in all the State,
      than Parson Morrel. His doctrines was right up and down, good and sharp;
      and he give saints and sinners their meat in due season; and for consolin'
      and comfortin' widders and orphans, Parson Morrel hedn't his match. The
      women sot lots by him; and he was allus' ready to take tea round, and make
      things pleasant and comfortable; and he hed a good story for every one,
      and a word for the children, and maybe an apple or a cookey in his pocket
      for 'em. Wal, you know there an't no pleasin' everybody; and ef Gabriel
      himself, right down out o' heaven, was to come and be a minister, I expect
      there'd be a pickin' at his wings, and sort o' fault-findin'. Now, Aunt
      Jerushy Scran and Aunt Polly Hokun they sed Parson Morrel wa'n't solemn
      enough. Ye see, there's them that thinks that a minister ought to be jest
      like the town hearse, so that ye think of death, judgment, and eternity,
      and nothin' else, when ye see him round; and ef they see a man rosy and
      chipper, and hevin' a pretty nice, sociable sort of a time, why they say
      he an't spiritooal minded. But, in my times, I've seen ministers the most
      awakenin' kind in the pulpit that was the liveliest when they was out
      on't. There is a time to laugh, Scriptur' says; tho' some folks never seem
      to remember that 'are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Sam, how came you to say it was Ike Babbit's fault? What was it
      about the sheep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, wal, yis! I'm a comin' to that 'are. It was all about them sheep. I
      expect they was the instrument the Devil sot to work to tempt Parson
      Morrel to laugh in prayer-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, there was old Dick, Ike's bell-wether, was the fightin'est old
      crittur that ever yer see. Why, Dick would butt at his own shadder; and
      everybody said it was a shame the old crittur should be left to run loose,
      'cause he run at the children, and scared the women half out their wits.
      Wal, I used to live out in that parish in them days. And Lem Sudoc and I
      used to go out sparkin' Sunday nights, to see the Larkin gals; and we had
      to go right 'cross the lot where Dick was: so we used to go and stand at
      the fence, and call. And Dick would see us, and put down his head, and run
      at us full chisel, and come bunt agin the fence; and then I'd ketch him by
      the horns, and hold him while Lem run and got over the fence t'other side
      the lot; and then I'd let go: and Lem would holler, and shake a stick at
      him, and away he'd go full butt at Lem; and Lem would ketch his horns, and
      hold him till I came over,&mdash;that was the way we managed Dick; but, I
      tell you, ef he come sudden up behind a fellow, he'd give him a butt in
      the small of his back that would make him run on all fours one while. He
      was a great rogue,&mdash;Dick was. Wal, that summer, I remember they hed
      old Deacon Titkins for tithing-man; and I tell you he give it to the boys
      lively. There wa'n't no sleepin' nor no playin'; for the deacon hed eyes
      like a gimblet, and he was quick as a cat, and the youngsters hed to look
      out for themselves. It did really seem as if the deacon was like them four
      beasts in the Revelations that was full o' eyes behind and before; for
      which ever way he was standin', if you gave only a wink, he was down on
      you, and hit you a tap with his stick. I know once Lem Sudoc jist wrote
      two words in the psalm-book and passed to Kesiah Larkin; and the deacon
      give him such a tap that Lem grew red as a beet, and vowed he'd be up with
      him some day for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lordy Massy, folks that is so chipper and high steppin' has to hev
      their come downs; and the deacon he hed to hev his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That 'are Sunday,&mdash;I 'member it now jest as well as if 'twas
      yesterday,&mdash;the parson he give us his gre't sermon, reconcilin'
      decrees and free agency: everybody said that 'are sermon was a
      masterpiece. He preached it up to Cambridge at Commencement, that year.
      Wal, it so happened it was one o' them bilin' hot days that come in
      August, when you can fairly hear the huckleberries a sizzlin', and cookin'
      on the bushes, and the locust keeps a gratin' like a red-hot saw. Wal,
      such times, decrees or no decrees, the best on us will get sleepy. The old
      meetin'-house stood right down at the foot of a hill that kep' off all the
      wind; and the sun blazed away at them gre't west winders: and there was
      pretty sleepy times there. Wal, the deacon, he flew round a spell, and
      woke up the children, and tapped the boys on the head, and kep' every
      thing straight as he could, till the sermon was most through, when he
      railly got most tuckered out; and he took a chair, and he sot down in the
      door right opposite the minister, and fairly got asleep himself, jest as
      the minister got up to make the last prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Parson Morrel hed a way o' prayin' with his eyes open. Folks said it
      wa'n't the best way: but it was Parson Morrel's way, anyhow; and so, as he
      was prayin', he couldn't help seein' that Deacon Tit-kins was a noddin'
      and a bobbin' out toward the place where old Dick was feedin' with the
      sheep, front o' the meetin'-house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lem and me we was sittin' where we could look out; and we jest sees old
      Dick stop feedin' and look at the deacon. The deacon hed a little round
      head as smooth as an apple, with a nice powdered wig on it: and he sot
      there makin' bobs and bows; and Dick begun to think it was suthin sort o'
      pussonal. Lem and me was sittin' jest where we could look out and see the
      hull picter; and Lem was fit to split.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Good, now,' says he: 'that crittur 'll pay the deacon off lively, pretty
      soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deacon bobbed his head a spell; and old Dick he shook his horns, and
      stamped at him sort o' threat-nin'. Finally the deacon he give a great
      bow, and brought his head right down at him; and old Dick he sot out full
      tilt and come down on him ker chunk, and knocked him head over heels into
      the broad aisle: and his wig flew one way and he t'other; and Dick made a
      lunge at it, as it flew, and carried it off on his horns.

      &ldquo;Wal, you may believe, that broke up the meetin' for one while: for Parson
      Morrel laughed out; and all the gals and boys they stomped and roared. And
      the old deacon he got up and begun rubbin' his shins, 'cause he didn't see
      the joke on't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You don't orter laugh,' says he: 'it's no laughin' matter; it's a solemn
      thing,' says he. 'I might hev been sent into 'tarnity by that darned
      crittur,' says he. Then they all roared and haw-hawed the more, to see the
      deacon dancin' round with his little shiny head, so smooth a fly would
      trip up on't. 'I believe, my soul, you'd laugh to see me in my grave,'
      says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the truth on't was, 'twas jist one of them bustin' up times that
      natur has, when there an't nothin' for it but to give in: 'twas jest like
      the ice breakin' up in the Charles River,&mdash;it all come at once, and
      no whoa to't. Sunday or no Sunday, sin or no sin, the most on 'em laughed
      till they cried, and couldn't help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the deacon, he went home feelin' pretty sore about it. Lem Sudoc, he
      picked up his wig, and handed it to him. Says he, 'Old Dick was playin'
      tithin'-man, wa'n't he, deacon? Teach you to make allowance for other
      folks that get sleepy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Miss Titkins she went over to Aunt Jerushy Scran's and Aunt Polly
      Hokum's; and they hed a pot o' tea over it, and 'greed it was awful of
      Parson Morrel to set sich an example, and suthin' hed got to be done about
      it. Miss Hokum said she allers knew that Parson Morrel hedn't no
      spiritooality; and now it hed broke out into open sin, and led all the
      rest of 'em into it; and Miss Titkins, she said such a man wa'n't fit to
      preach; and Miss Hokum said she couldn't never hear him agin: and the next
      Sunday the deacon and his wife they hitched up and driv eight miles over
      to Parson Lothrop's and took Aunt Polly on the back seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the thing growed and growed, till it seemed as if there wa'n't
      nothin' else talked about, 'cause Aunt Polly and Miss Titkins and Jerushy
      Scran they didn't do nothin' but talk about it; and that sot everybody
      else a-talkin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, it was 'greed they must hev a council to settle the hash. So all
      the wimmen they went to choppin' mince, and makin' up pumpkin pies and
      cranberry tarts, andb'ilin' doughnuts,&mdash;gettin' ready for the
      ministers and delegates; 'cause councils always eats powerful: and they
      hed quite a stir, like a gineral trainin'. The hosses they was hitched all
      up and down the stalls, a-stompin' and switchin' their tails; and all the
      wimmen was a-talkin'; and they hed up everybody round for witnesses. And
      finally Parson Morrel he says, 'Brethren,' says he, 'jest let me tell you
      the story jest as it happened; and, if you don't every one of you laugh as
      hard as I did, why, then, I 'll give up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The parson he was a master-hand at settin' off a story; and, afore he'd
      done, he got 'em all in sich a roar they didn't know where to leave off.
      Finally, they give sentence that there hedn't no temptation took him but
      such as is common to man; but they advised him afterwards allers to pray
      with his eyes shet; and the parson he confessed he orter 'a done it, and
      meant to do better in future: and so they settled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, boys,&rdquo; said Sam, who always drew a moral, &ldquo;ye see, it larns you, you
      must take care what ye look at, ef ye want to keep from laughin' in
      meetin'&rdquo;.

      HAT is it about that old house in Sherbourne?&rdquo; said Aunt Nabby to Sam
      Lawson, as he sat drooping over the coals of a great fire one October
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Lois was gone to Boston on a visit; and, the smart spice of her
      scepticism being absent, we felt the more freedom to start our
      story-teller on one of his legends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Nabby sat trotting her knitting-needles on a blue-mixed yarn
      stocking. Grandmamma was knitting in unison at the other side of the fire.
      Grandfather sat studying &ldquo;The Boston Courier.&rdquo; The wind outside was
      sighing in fitful wails, creaking the pantry-doors, occasionally puffing
      in a vicious gust down the broad throat of the chimney. It was a drizzly,
      sleety evening; and the wet lilac-bushes now and then rattled and splashed
      against the window as the wind moaned and whispered through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We boys had made preparation for a comfortable evening. We had enticed Sam
      to the chimney-corner, and drawn him a mug of cider. We had set down a row
      of apples to roast on the hearth, which even now were giving faint sighs
      and sputters as their plump sides burst in the genial heat. The big oak
      back-log simmered and bubbled, and distilled large drops down amid the
      ashes; and the great hickory forestick had just burned out into solid
      bright coals, faintly skimmed over with white ashes. The whole area of the
      big chimney was full of a sleepy warmth and brightness just calculated to
      call forth fancies and visions. It only wanted somebody now to set Sam
      off; and Aunt Nabby broached the ever-interesting subject of haunted
      houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, Miss Badger,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I ben over there, and walked round
      that are house consid'able; and I talked with Granny Hokum and Aunt Polly,
      and they've putty much come to the conclusion that they 'll hev to move
      out on't. Ye see these 'ere noises, they keep 'em awake nights; and Aunt
      Polly, she gets 'stericky; and Hannah Jane, she says, ef they stay in the
      house, <i>she</i> can't live with 'em no longer. And what can them lone
      women do without Hannah Jane? Why, Hannah Jane, she says these two months
      past she's seen a woman, regular, walking up and down the front hall
      between twelve and one o'clock at night; and it's jist the image and body
      of old Ma'am Tillotson, Parson Hokum's mother, that everybody know'd was a
      thunderin' kind o' woman, that kep' every thing in a muss while she was
      alive. What the old crittur's up to now there ain't no knowin'. Some folks
      seems to think it's a sign Granny Hokum's time's comin'. But Lordy massy!
      says she to me, says she, 'Why, Sam, I don't know nothin' what I've done,
      that Ma'am Tillotson should be set loose on me.' Anyway they've all got so
      narvy, that Jed Hokum has ben up from Needham, and is goin' to cart 'em
      all over to live with him. Jed, he's for hushin' on't up, 'cause he says
      it brings a bad name on the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I talked with Jed about it; and says I to Jed, says I, 'Now, ef you
      'll take my advice, jist you give that are old house a regular
      overhaulin', and paint it over with tew coats o' paint, and that are 'll
      clear 'em out, if any thing will. Ghosts is like bedbugs,&mdash;they can't
      stan' fresh paint,' says I. 'They allers clear out. I've seen it tried on
      a ship that got haunted.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sam, do ships get haunted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure they do!&mdash;haunted the wust kind. Why, I could tell ye a
      story'd make your har rise on e'end, only I'm 'fraid of frightening boys
      when they're jist going to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you can't frighten Horace,&rdquo; said my grandmother. &ldquo;He will go and sit
      out there in the graveyard till nine o'clock nights, spite of all I tell
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell, Sam!&rdquo; we urged. &ldquo;What was it about the ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam lifted his mug of cider, deliberately turned it round and round in his
      hands, eyed it affectionately, took a long drink, and set it down in front
      of him on the hearth, and began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye 'member I telled you how I went to sea down East, when I was a boy,
      'long with Tom Toothacre. Wal, Tom, he reeled off a yarn one night that
      was 'bout the toughest I ever hed the pullin' on. And it come all
      straight, too, from Tom. 'Twa'n't none o' yer hearsay: 'twas what he seen
      with his own eyes. Now, there wa'n't no nonsense 'bout Tom, not a bit
      on't; and he wa'n't afeard o' the divil himse'f; and he ginally saw
      through things about as straight as things could be seen through. This
      'ere happened when Tom was mate o' 'The Albatross,' and they was a-runnin'
      up to the Banks for a fare o' fish. 'The Albatross' was as handsome a
      craft as ever ye see; and Cap'n Sim Witherspoon, he was skipper&mdash;a
      rail nice likely man he was. I heard Tom tell this 'ere one night to the
      boys on 'The Brilliant,' when they was all a-settin' round the stove in
      the cabin one foggy night that we was to anchor in Frenchman's Bay, and
      all kind o' lavin' off loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, he said they was having a famous run up to the Banks. There was a
      spankin' southerly, that blew 'em along like all natur'; and they was
      hevin' the best kind of a time, when this 'ere southerly brought a pesky
      fog down on 'em, and it grew thicker than hasty-puddin'. Ye see, that
      are's the pester o' these 'ere southerlies: they's the biggest
      fog-breeders there is goin'. And so, putty soon, you couldn't see half
      ship's length afore you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, they all was down to supper, except Dan Sawyer at the wheel, when
      there come sich a crash as if heaven and earth was a-splittin', and then a
      scrapin' and thump bumpin' under the ship, and gin 'em sich a h'ist that
      the pot o' beans went rollin', and brought up jam ag'in the bulk-head; and
      the fellers was keeled over,&mdash;men and pork and beans kinder
      permiscus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The divil!' says Tom Toothacre, 'we've run down somebody. Look out, up
      there!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dan, he shoved the helm hard down, and put her up to the wind, and sung
      out, 'Lordy massy! we've struck her right amidships!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Struck what?' they all yelled, and tumbled up on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, a little schooner,' says Dan. 'Didn't see her till we was right on
      her. She's gone down tack and sheet. Look! there's part o' the wreck
      a-floating off: don't ye see?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, they didn't see, 'cause it was so thick you couldn't hardly see your
      hand afore your face. But they put about, and sent out a boat, and kind o'
      sarched round; but, Lordy massy! ye might as well looked for a drop of
      water in the Atlantic Ocean. Whoever they was, it was all done gone and
      over with 'em for this life, poor critturs!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom says they felt confoundedly about it; but what could they do? Lordy
      massy! what can any on us do? There's places where folks jest lets go
      'cause they hes to. Things ain't as they want 'em, and they can't alter
      'em. Sailors ain't so rough as they look: they'z feelin' critturs, come to
      put things right to 'em. And there wasn't one on 'em who wouldn't 'a'
      worked all night for a chance o' saving some o' them poor fellows. But
      there 'twas, and 'twa'n't no use trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, so they sailed on; and by'm by the wind kind o' chopped round
      no'theast, and then come round east, and sot in for one of them regular
      east blows and drizzles that takes the starch out o' fellers more'n a
      regular storm. So they concluded they might as well put into a little bay
      there, and come to anchor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they sot an anchor-watch, and all turned in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now comes the particular curus part o' Tom's story: and it more
      curus 'cause Tom was one that wouldn't 'a' believed no other man that had
      told it. Tom was one o' your sort of philosophers. He was fer lookin' into
      things, and wa'n't in no hurry 'bout believin'; so that this 'un was more
      'markablfe on account of it's bein' Tom that seen it than ef it had ben
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom says that night he hed a pesky toothache that sort o' kep' grumblin'
      and jumpin' so he couldn't go to sleep; and he lay in his bunk, a-turnin'
      this way and that, till long past twelve o clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom had a'thwart-ship bunk where he could see into every bunk on board,
      except Bob Coffin's; and Bob was on the anchor-watch. Wal, he lay there,
      tryin' to go to sleep, hearin' the men snorin' like bull-frogs in a swamp,
      and watchin' the lantern a-swingin' back and forward; and the sou'westers
      and pea-jackets were kinder throwin' their long shadders up and down as
      the vessel sort o' rolled and pitched,&mdash;for there was a heavy swell
      on,&mdash;and then he'd hear Bob Coffin tramp, tramp, trampin' overhead,&mdash;for
      Bob had a pretty heavy foot of his own,&mdash;and all sort o' mixed up
      together with Tom's toothache, so he couldn't get to sleep. Finally, Tom,
      he bit off a great chaw o' 'baccy, and got it well sot in his cheek, and
      kind o' turned over to lie on't, and ease the pain. Wal, he says he laid a
      spell, and dropped off in a sort o' doze, when he woke in sich a chill his
      teeth chattered, and the pain come on like a 'knife, and he bounced over,
      thinking the fire had gone out in the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, sure enough, he see a man a-crouchin' over the stove, with his back
      to him, a-stretchin' out his hands to warm 'em. He had on a sou'wester and
      a pea-jacket, with a red tippet round his neck; and his clothes was
      drippin' as if he'd just come in from a rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What the divil!' says Tom. And he riz right up, and rubbed his eyes.
      'Bill Bridges,' says he, 'what shine be you up to now?' For Bill was a
      master oneasy crittur, and allers a-gettin' up and walkin' nights; and
      Tom, he thought it was Bill. But in a minute he looked over, and there,
      sure enough, was Bill, fast asleep in his bunk, mouth wide open, snoring
      like a Jericho ram's-horn. Tom looked round, and counted every man in his
      bunk, and then says he, 'Who the devil is this? for there's Bob Coffin on
      deck, and the rest is all here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Tom wa'n't a man to be put under too easy. He hed his thoughts about
      him allers; and the fust he thought in every pinch was what to do. So he
      sot considerin' a minute, sort o' winkin' his eyes to be sure he saw
      straight, when, sure enough, there come another man backin' down the
      companion-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal, there's Bob Coffin, anyhow,' says Tom to himself. But no, the other
      man, he turned: Tom see his face; and, sure as you live, it was the face
      of a dead corpse. Its eyes was sot, and it jest came as still across the
      cabin, and sot down by the stove, and kind o' shivered, and put out its
      hands as if it was gettin' warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom said that there was a cold air round in the cabin, as if an iceberg
      was comin' near, and he felt cold chills running down his back; but he
      jumped out of his bunk, and took a step forward. 'Speak!' says he. 'Who be
      you? and what do you want?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never spoke, nor looked up, but kept kind o' shivering and crouching
      over the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wal,' says Tom, 'I 'll see who you be, anyhow.' And he walked right up
      to the last man that come in, and reached out to catch hold of his
      coat-collar; but his hand jest went through him like moonshine, and in a
      minute he all faded away; and when he turned round the other one was gone
      too. Tom stood there, looking this way and that; but there warn't nothing
      but the old stove, and the lantern swingin', and the men all snorin' round
      in their bunks. Tom, he sung out to Bob Coffin. 'Hullo, up there!' says
      he. But Bob never answered, and Tom, he went up, and found Bob down on his
      knees, his teeth a-chatterin' like a bag o' nails, trying to say his
      prayers; and all he could think of was, 'Now I lay me,' and he kep' going
      that over and over. Ye see, boys, Bob was a drefful wicked, swearin'
      crittur, and hadn't said no prayers since he was tew years old, and it
      didn't come natural to him. Tom give a grip on his collar, and shook him.
      'Hold yer yawp,' said he. 'What you howlin' about? What's up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh, Lordy massy!' says Bob, 'we're sent for,&mdash;all on us,&mdash;there's
      been two on 'em: both on 'em went right by me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Tom, he hed his own thoughts; but he was bound to get to the bottom
      of things, anyway. Ef 'twas the devil, well and good&mdash;he wanted to
      know it. Tom jest wanted to hev the matter settled one way or t'other: so
      he got Bob sort o' stroked down, and made him tell what he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob, he stood to it that he was a-standin' right for'ard, a-leanin' on
      the windlass, and kind o' hummin' a tune, when he looked down, and see a
      sort o' queer light in the fog; and he went and took a look over the bows,
      when up came a man's head in a sort of sou'wester, and then a pair of
      hands, and catched at the bob-stay; and then the hull figger of a man riz
      right out o' the water, and clim up on the martingale till he could reach
      the jib-stay with his hands, and then he swung himself right up onto the
      bowsprit, and stepped aboard, and went past Bob, right aft, and down into
      the cabin. And he hadn't more'n got down, afore he turned round, and there
      was another comin' in over the bowsprit, and he went by him, and down
      below: so there was two on 'em, jest as Tom had seen in the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom he studied on it a spell, and finally says he, 'Bob, let you and me
      keep this 'ere to ourselves, and see ef it 'll come again. Ef it don't,
      well and good: ef it does&mdash;why, we 'll see about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Tom he told Cap'n Witherspoon, and the Cap'n he agreed to keep an eye
      out the next night. But there warn't nothing said to the rest o' the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the next night they put Bill Bridges on the watch. The fog had
      lifted, and they had a fair wind, and was going on steady. The men all
      turned in, and went fast asleep, except Cap'n Witherspoon, Tom, and Bob
      Coffin. Wal, sure enough, 'twixt twelve and one o'clock, the same thing
      came over, only there war four men 'stead o' two. They come in jes' so
      over the bowsprit, and they looked neither to right nor left, but dim down
      stairs, and sot down, and crouched and shivered over the stove jist like
      the others. Wal, Bill Bridges, he came tearin' down like a wild-cat,
      frightened half out o' his wits, screechin' 'Lord, have mercy! we're all
      goin' to the devil!' And then they all vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now, Cap'n, what's to be done?' says Tom. 'Ef these 'ere fellows is to
      take passage, we can't do nothin' with the boys: that's clear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, so it turned out; for, come next night, there was six on 'em come
      in, and the story got round, and the boys was all on eend. There wa'n't no
      doin' nothin' with 'em. Ye see, it's allers jest so. Not but what dead
      folks is jest as 'spectable as they was afore they's dead. These might 'a'
      been as good fellers as any aboard; but it's human natur'. The minute a
      feller's dead, why, you sort o' don't know 'bout him; and it's kind o'
      skeery hevin' on him round; and so 'twan't no wonder the boys didn't feel
      as if they could go on with the vy'ge, ef these 'ere fellers was all to
      take passage. Come to look, too, there war consid'able of a leak stove in
      the vessel; and the boys, they all stood to it, ef they went farther, that
      they'd all go to the bottom. For, ye see, once the story got a-goin',
      every one on 'em saw a new thing every night. One on 'em saw the bait-mill
      a-grindin', without no hands to grind it; and another saw fellers up
      aloft, workin' in the sails. Wal, the fact war, they jest had to put
      about,&mdash;run back to Castine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the owners, they hushed up things the best they could; and they put
      the vessel on the stocks, and worked her over, and put a new coat o' paint
      on her, and called her 'The Betsey Ann;' and she went a good vy'ge to the
      Banks, and brought home the biggest fare o' fish that had been for a long
      time; and she's made good vy'ges ever since; and that jest proves what
      I've been a-saying,&mdash;that there's nothin' to drive out ghosts like
      fresh paint.&rdquo;

      AL, now, this 'ere does beat all! I wouldn't 'a' thought it o' the deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      So spoke Sam Lawson, drooping in a discouraged, contemplative attitude in
      front of an equally discouraged looking horse, that had just been brought
      to him by the Widow Simpkins for medical treatment. Among Sam's many
      accomplishments he was reckoned in the neighborhood an oracle in all
      matters of this kind, especially by women, whose helplessness in meeting
      such emergencies found unfailing solace under his compassionate
      willingness to attend to any business that did not strictly belong to him,
      and from which no pecuniary return was to be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Widow Simpkins had bought this horse of Deacon Atkins, apparently a
      fairly well-appointed brute, and capable as he was good-looking. A short,
      easy drive, when the deacon held the reins, had shown off his points to
      advantage; and the widow's small stock of ready savings had come forth
      freely in payment for what she thought was a bargain. When, soon after
      coming into possession, she discovered that her horse, if driven with any
      haste, panted in a fearful manner, and that he appeared to be growing
      lame, she waxed wroth, and went to the deacon in anger, to be met only
      with the smooth reminder that the animal was all right when she took him;
      that she had seen him tried herself. The widow was of a nature somewhat
      spicy, and expressed herself warmly: &ldquo;It's a cheat and a shame, and I 'll
      take the law on ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What law will you take?&rdquo; said the unmoved deacon. &ldquo;Wasn't it a fair
      bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll take the law of God,&rdquo; said the widow with impotent indignation; and
      she departed to pour her cares and trials into the ever ready ear of Sam.
      Having assumed the care of the animal, he now sat contemplating it in a
      sort of trance of melancholy reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, boys!&rdquo; he broke out, &ldquo;why didn't she come to me afore she bought
      this crittur? Why, I knew all about him! That 'are crittur was jest ruined
      a year ago last summer, when Tom, the deacon's boy there, come home from
      college. Tom driv him over to Sherburn and back that 'are hot Fourth of
      July. 'Member it, 'cause I saw the crittur when he come home. I sot up
      with Tom takin' care of him all night. That 'are crittur had the thumps
      all night, and he hain't never been good for nothin' since. I telled the
      deacon he was a gone hoss then, and wouldn't never be good for nothin'.
      The deacon, he took off his shoes, and let him run to pastur' all summer,
      and he's ben a-feedin' and nussin' on him up; and now he's put him off on
      the widder. I wouldn't 'a' thought it o' the deacon! Why, this hoss 'll
      never be no good to her! That 'are's a used-up crittur, any fool may see!
      He 'll mabbe do for about a quarter of an hour on a smooth road; but come
      to drive him as a body wants to drive, why, he blows like my bellowsis;
      and the deacon knew it&mdash;must 'a' known it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sam!&rdquo; we exclaimed, &ldquo;ain't the deacon a good man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, there's where the shoe pinches! In a gin'al way the deacon <i>is</i>
      a good man&mdash;he's con-sid'able more than middlin' good: gin'ally he
      adorns his perfession. On most p'ints I don't hev nothin' agin the deacon;
      and this 'ere ain't a bit like him. But there 'tis! Come to hosses,
      there's where the unsanctified natur' comes out. Folks will cheat about
      hosses when they won't about 'most nothin' else.&rdquo; And Sam leaned back on
      his cold forge, now empty of coal, and seemed to deliver himself to a
      mournful train of general reflection. &ldquo;Yes, hosses does seem to be sort o'
      unregenerate critturs,&rdquo; he broke out: &ldquo;there's suthin' about hosses that
      deceives the very elect. The best o' folks gets tripped up when they come
      to deal in hosses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sam, is there any thing bad in horses?&rdquo; we interjected timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't the hosses, boys,&rdquo; said Sam with solemnity. &ldquo;Lordy massy! the
      hosses is all right enough! Hosses is scriptural animals. Elijah went up
      to heaven in a chari't with hosses; and then all them lots o' hosses in
      the Ravelations,&mdash;black and white and red, and all sorts o' colors.
      That 'are shows hosses goes to heaven; but it's more'n the folks that hev
      'em is likely to, ef they don't look out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ministers, now,&rdquo; continued Sam in a soliloquizing vein&mdash;&ldquo;folks
      allers thinks it's suthin' sort o' shaky in a minister to hev much to do
      with hosses,&mdash;sure to get 'em into trouble. There was old Parson
      Williams of North Billriky got into a drefful mess about a hoss. Lordy
      massy! he warn't to blame, neither; but he got into the dreffulest scrape
      you ever heard on&mdash;come nigh to unsettlin' him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Sam! tell us all about it,&rdquo; we boys shouted, delighted with the
      prospect of a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, wait now till I get off this crittur's shoes, and we 'll take him up
      to pastur', and then we can kind o' set by the river, and fish. Hepsy
      wanted a mess o' fish for supper, and I was cal'latin' to git some for
      her. You boys go and be digging bait, and git yer lines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, as we were sitting tranquilly beside the Charles River, watching
      our lines, Sam's narrative began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, boys, Parson Williams&mdash;he's dead now, but when I was a boy
      he was one of the gret men round here. He writ books. He writ a tract agin
      the Armenians, and put 'em down; and he writ a big book on the millennium
      (I've got that 'are book now); and he was a smart preacher. Folks said he
      had invitations to settle in Boston, and there ain't no doubt he might 'a'
      hed a Boston parish ef he'd 'a' ben a mind ter take it; but he'd got a
      good settlement and a handsome farm in North Billriky, and didn't care to
      move: thought, I s'pose, that 'twas better to be number one in a little
      place than number two in a big un. Anyway, he carried all before him where
      he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parson Williams was a tall, straight, personable man; come of good family&mdash;father
      and grand'ther before him all ministers. He was putty up and down, and
      commandin' in his ways, and things had to go putty much as he said. He was
      a good deal sot by, Parson Williams was, and his wife was a Derby,&mdash;one
      o' them rich Salem Derbys,&mdash;and brought him a lot o' money; and so
      they lived putty easy and comfortable so fur as this world's goods goes.
      Well, now, the parson wan't reely what you call worldly-minded; but then
      he was one o' them folks that <i>knows what's good</i> in temporals as
      well as sperituals, and allers liked to hev the best that there was goin';
      and he allers had an eye to a good boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there was Parson Adams and Parson Scranton, and most of the other
      ministers: they didn't know and didn't care what hoss they hed; jest
      jogged round with these 'ere poundin', potbellied, sleepy critturs that
      ministers mostly hes,&mdash;good enough to crawl round to funerals and
      ministers' meetin's and associations and sich; but Parson Williams, he
      allers would hev a hoss as was a hoss. He looked out for <i>blood</i>;
      and, when these 'ere Vermont fellers would come down with a drove, the
      parson, he hed his eyes open, and knew what was what. Couldn't none of 'em
      cheat him on hoss flesh. And so one time when Zach Buel was down with a
      drove, the doctor, he bought the best hoss in the lot. Zach said he never
      see a parson afore that he couldn't cheat; but he said the doctor reely
      knew as much as he did, and got the very one he'd meant to 'a' kept for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This 'ere hoss was a peeler, I 'll tell you! They'd called him Tamerlane,
      from some heathen feller or other: the boys called him Tam, for short. Tam
      was a gret character. All the fellers for miles round knew the doctor's
      Tam, and used to come clear over from the other parishes to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, this 'ere sot up Cuff's back high, I tell you! Cuff was the doctor's
      nigger man, and he was nat 'lly a drefful proud crittur. The way he would
      swell and strut and brag about the doctor and his folks and his things!
      The doctor used to give Cuff his cast-off clothes; and Cuff would prance
      round in 'em, and seem to think he was a doctor of divinity himself, and
      had the charge of all natur'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cuff he reely made an idol o' that 'are hoss,&mdash;a reg'lar
      graven image, and bowed down and worshipped him. He didn't think nothin'
      was too good for him. He washed and brushed and curried him, and rubbed
      him down till he shone like a lady's satin dress; and he took pride in
      ridin' and drivin' him, 'cause it was what the doctor wouldn't let nobody
      else do but himself. You see, Tam warn't no lady's hoss. Miss Williams was
      'fraid as death of him; and the parson, he hed to git her a sort o'
      low-sperited crittur that she could drive herself. But he liked to drive
      Tam; and he liked to go round the country on his back, and a fine figure
      of a man he was on him too. He didn't let nobody else back him, or handle
      the reins, but Cuff; and Cuff was drefful set up about it, and he swelled
      and bragged about that ar boss all round the country. Nobody couldn't put
      in a word 'bout any other hoss, without Cuff's feathers would be all up,
      stiff as a tom-turkey's tail; and that's how Cuff got the doctor into
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see, there nat 'lly was others that thought they'd got horses, and
      didn't want to be crowed over. There was Bill Atkins out to the west
      parish, and Ike Sanders, that kep' a stable up to Pequot Holler: they was
      down a-lookin' at the parson's hoss, and a-bettin' on their'n, and
      a-darin' Cuff to race with 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Cuff, he couldn't stan' it, and, when the doctor's back was turned,
      he'd be off on the sly, and they'd hev their race; and Tam, he beat 'em
      all. Tam, ye see, boys, was a hoss that couldn't and wouldn't hev a hoss
      ahead of him&mdash;he jest <i>wouldn't!</i> Ef he dropped down dead in his
      tracks the next minit, he <i>would</i> be ahead; and he allers got ahead.
      And so his name got up, and fellers kep' comin' to try their horses; and
      Cuff'd take Tam out to race with fust one and then another till this 'ere
      got to be a reg'lar thing, and begun to be talked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks sort o' wondered if the doctor knew; but Cuff was sly as a weasel,
      and allers had a story ready for every turn. Cuff was one of them fellers
      that could talk a bird off a bush,&mdash;master hand he was to slick
      things over!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was folks as said they believed the doctor was knowin' to it, and
      that he felt a sort o' carnal pride sech as a minister oughtn't fer to
      hev, and so shet his eyes to what was a-goin' on. Aunt Sally Nickerson
      said she was sure on't.'Twas all talked over down to old Miss Bummiger's
      funeral, and Aunt Sally, she said the church ought to look into't. But
      everybody knew Aunt Sally: she was allers watchin' for folks' haltin's,
      and settin' on herself up to jedge her neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I never believed nothin' agin Parson Williams: it was all Cuff's
      contrivances. But the fact was, the fellers all got their blood up, and
      there was hoss-racin' in all the parishes; and it got so they'd even race
      hosses a Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, of course they never got the doctor's hoss out a Sunday. Cuff
      wouldn't 'a', durst to do that, Lordy massy, no! He was allers there in
      church, settin' up in the doctor's clothes, rollin' up his eyes, and
      lookin' as pious as ef he never thought o' racin' hosses. He was an awful
      solemn-lookin' nigger in church, Cuff was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there was a lot o' them fellers up to Pequot Holler&mdash;Bill
      Atkins, and Ike Sanders, and Tom Peters, and them Hokum boys&mdash;used to
      go out arter meetin' Sunday arternoon, and race hosses. Ye see, it was
      jest close to the State-line, and, if the s'lectmen was to come down on
      'em, they could jest whip over the line, and they couldn't take 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, it got to be a great scandal. The fellers talked about it up to the
      tavern, and the deacons and the tithingman, they took it up and went to
      Parson Williams about it; and the parson he told 'em jest to keep still,
      not let the fellers know that they was bein' watched, and next Sunday he
      and the tithingman and the constable, they'd ride over, and catch 'em in
      the very act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So next Sunday arternoon Parson Williams and Deacon Popkins and Ben
      Bradley (he was constable that year), they got on to their hosses, and
      rode over to Pequot Holler. The doctor's blood was up, and he meant to
      come down on 'em strong; for that was his way of doin' in his parish. And
      they was in a sort o' day o'-jedgment frame o' mind, and jogged along
      solemn as a hearse, till, come to rise the hill above the holler, they see
      three or four fellers with their hosses gittin' ready to race; and the
      parson says he, 'Let's come on quiet, and get behind these bushes, and we
      'll see what they're up to, and catch 'em in the act.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the mischief on't was, that Ike Sanders see 'em comin', and he knowed
      Tam in a minit,&mdash;Ike knowed Tam of old,&mdash;and he jest tipped the
      wink to the rest. 'Wait, boys,' says he: 'let 'em git close up, and then I
      'll give the word, and the doctor's hoss will be racin' ahead like
      thunder.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, so the doctor and his folks, they drew up behind the bushes, and
      stood there innocent as could be, and saw 'em gittin' ready to start. Tam,
      he begun to snuffle and paw; but the doctor never mistrusted what he was
      up to till Ike sung out, 'Go it, boys!' and the hosses all started, when,
      sure as you live, boys! Tam give one fly, and was over the bushes, and in
      among 'em, goin' it like chain-lightnin' ahead of 'em all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deacon Popkins and Ben Bradley jest stood and held their breath to see em
      all goin' it so like thunder; and the doctor, he was took so sudden it was
      all he could do to jest hold on anyway: so away he went, and trees and
      bushes and fences streaked by him like ribbins. His hat flew off behind
      him, and his wig arter, and got catched in a barberry-bush; but Lordy
      massy! he couldn't stop to think o' them. He jest leaned down, and caught
      Tam round the neck, and held on for dear life till they come to the
      stopping-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Tam was ahead of them all, sure enough, and was snorting and
      snuffling as if he'd got the very old boy in him, and was up to racing
      some more on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That 'ere Ike Sanders was the impudentest feller that ever you see, and
      he roared and rawhawed at the doctor. 'Good for you, parson!' says he.
      'You beat us all holler,' says he. 'Takes a parson for that, don't it,
      boys?' he said. And then he and Ike and Ton; and the two Hokum boys, they
      jest roared, and danced round like wild critturs. Wal, now, only think
      on't, boys, what a situation that 'are was for a minister,&mdash;a man
      that had come out with the best of motives to put a stop to
      sabbath-breakin' I There he was all rumpled up and dusty, and his wig
      hangin' in the bushes, and these 'ere ungodly fellers gettin' the laugh on
      him, and all acause o' that 'are hoss. There's times, boys, when ministers
      must be tempted to swear if there ain't preventin' grace, and this was one
      o' them times to Parson Williams. They say he got red in the face, and
      looked as if he should bust, but he didn't say nothin': he scorned to
      answer. The sons o' Zeruiah was too hard for him, and he let 'em hev their
      say. But when they'd got through, and Ben had brought him his hat and wig,
      and brushed and settled him ag'in, the parson, he says, 'Well, boys, ye've
      had your say and your laugh; but I warn you now I won't have this thing
      going on here any more,' says he: 'so mind yourselves.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, the boys see that the doctor's blood was up, and they rode off
      pretty quiet; and I believe they never raced no more in that spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there ain't no tellin' the talk this 'ere thing made. Folks will
      talk, you know; and there warn't a house in all Billriky, nor in the south
      parish nor centre, where it warn't had over and discussed. There was the
      deacon, and Ben Bradley was there, to witness and show jest how the thing
      was, and that the doctor was jest in the way of his duty; but folks said
      it made a great scandal; that a minister hadn't no business to hev that
      kind o' hoss, and that he'd give the enemy occasion to speak
      reproachfully. It reely did seem as if Tam's sins was imputed to the
      doctor; and folks said he ought to sell Tam right away, and get a sober
      minister's hoss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But others said it was Cuff that had got Tam into bad ways, and they do
      say that Cuff had to catch it pretty lively when the doctor come to settle
      with him. Cuff thought his time had come, sure enough, and was so scairt
      that he turned blacker'n ever: he got enough to cure him o' hoss-racin'
      for one while. But Cuff got over it arter a while, and so did the doctor.
      Lordy massy! there ain't nothin' lasts forever! Wait long enough, and
      'most every thing blows over. So it turned out about the doctor. There was
      a rumpus and a fuss, and folks talked and talked, and advised; everybody
      had their say: but the doctor kep' right straight on, and kep' his hoss
      all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ministers, they took it up in the association; but, come to tell the
      story, it sot 'em all a-laughin', so they couldn't be very hard on the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor felt sort o' streaked at fust when they told the story on him;
      he didn't jest like it: but he got used to it, and finally, when he was
      twitted on't, he'd sort o' smile, and say, 'Anyway, Tam beat 'em: that's
      one comfort.'&rdquo;

    <p>
      HE sacred work of preparation for Thanksgiving was at hand. Our kitchen
      was fragrant with the smell of cinnamon, cloves, and allspice which we
      boys were daily set to pound in the great lignum-vitæ mortar. Daily the
      great oven flamed without cessation; and the splitting of oven-wood kept
      us youngsters so busy, that we scarce had a moment to play: yet we did it
      with a cheerful mind, inspired by the general aroma of coming festivity
      abroad in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold us this evening around the kitchen-fire, which crackled and roared
      up the wide chimney, brightening with its fluttering radiance the farthest
      corner of the ample room. A tub of rosy-cheeked apples, another of golden
      quinces, and a bushel-basket filled with ruby cranberries, stood in the
      midst of the circle. All hands were busy. Grandmother in one corner was
      superintending us boys as we peeled and quartered the fruit,&mdash;an
      operation in which grandfather took a helping hand; Aunt Lois was busily
      looking over and sorting cranberries, when a knock at the door announced a
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, I s'pose that's Sam Lawson, of course,&rdquo; snapped Aunt Lois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Lois generally spoke with a snap; but about Thanksgiving time it had
      a cheery ring, like the snapping of our brisk kitchen-fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evenin', Miss Badger and Miss Lois,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;I see yer winders so
      bright, I couldn't help wantin' to come in and help ye pare apples, or
      suthin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We boys made haste to give Sam the warmest welcome, and warmest place in
      the chimney-corner, and to accommodate him with a tin pan full of quinces,
      and a knife, when he was soon settled among us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, this 'ere does look cheerful,&mdash;looks like Thanksgiving,&rdquo; he
      began. &ldquo;Wal, Lordy massy! we've got a great deal to be thankful for in
      this 'ere land o' privileges; hain't we, deacon? I was a-comin' 'round by
      Mis' Lothrop's to-day; and her Dinah, she told me the Doctor was gettin' a
      great sermon out on the hundred and twenty-fourth Psalm: 'If it had not
      been the Lord who was on our side when men rose up against us, then they
      had swallowed us up.' He's a-goin' to show all our deliverances in the
      war. I expect it 'll be a whale of a sermon, 'cause, when our minister
      sets out to do a thing, he mos' generally does it up to the handle. Tell
      ye what, boys, you must listen with all your ears: you 'll never know what
      times them was if you don't&mdash;you don't know what liberty cost us all.
      There's your gran'ther, now, he could tell ye: he 'members when he went
      off to Lexington with his gun on his shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, grandfather! did <i>you</i> go?&rdquo; we both exclaimed with wide eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said my grandfather, &ldquo;'tain't worth talkin' about what I
      did. I was in my mill that day, minding my business, when brother Con, he
      burst in, and says he, 'Look here, Bill, the regulars are goin' up to
      Concord to destroy our stores, and we must all go. Come, get your gun.'
      Well, I said I was a miller, and millers were exempt from duty; but Con
      wouldn't let me alone. 'Get down your gun,' says he. 'Suppose we're going
      to let them British fellers walk over us?' says he. Well, Con always had
      his way of me; and I got my gun, and we started out through the woods over
      to Concord. We lived at Weston then, ye see. Well, when we got on the brow
      of the hill, we looked over, and, sure enough, there on burying-ground
      hill was the British regulars. The hill was all alive with 'em, marching
      here and there in their scarlet coats like so many bees out of a hive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Con,' says I, 'jest look there. What are you going to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Shoot some of 'em, I know,' says Con.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so we ran along, hiding behind trees and bushes and stone walls, till
      we got near enough to get a shot at 'em. You see, they broke up into
      companies, and went here and there about town, looking for the stores; and
      then, as we got a chance here and there, we marked our men, and popped,
      and then we'd run, and take aim somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, that are wa'n't the hull on't,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Why, there was
      hundreds of fellers doin' just the same all round: it was jest
      pop-pop-pop! from every barn, and every bush, and clump o' trees, all
      along the way. Men was picked off all the time; and they couldn't see who
      did it, and it made 'em mad as fury. Why, I 'member Mis' Tom Bigelow, she
      that was Sary Jones, told me how they sot her mother's house afire and
      burnt it down, 'cause their nigger man Cæsar popped at 'em out o' the
      buttery window. They didn't tell him to; but Cæsar, he was full of fight,
      like all the rest on 'em. Lordy massy! the niggers went for suthin' in
      them times! Their blood was up as quick as anybody's. Why, there was old
      Pompey Lovejoy lived over by Pomp's pond in Andover, he hitched up his
      wagon, and driv over with two barrels o' cider and some tin dippers, and
      was round all day givin' drinks o' cider to our men when they got het and
      thirsty and tired. It was a pretty warm day for April, that was. Pomp has
      told me the story many a time. 'Twas all the cider he had; but cider goes
      for suthin', as well as gunpowder in its place, and Pomp's cider come jest
      right that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But grandfather,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what happened to you over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; said grandfather placidly, &ldquo;I wasn't killed; but I come
      pretty nigh it. You see, they sent into Boston for re-enforcements; and,
      by the time we got to Lexington, Earl Percy was marching out with fresh
      troops and cannon. Con and I were standing on the meetin'-house steps,
      when there come a terrible bang, and something struck right over our
      heads, and went into the meetin'-house. 'Why, Bill!' says Con, 'what's
      that?'&mdash;'They've got cannon: that's what that is,' says I. 'Let's run
      'round the other side.' So we did; but just as we got round there, there
      come another bang, and a ball crashed right through the meetin'-house, and
      come out of the pulpit window. Well, we saw there was no staying there: so
      we run then, and got into a little clump of trees behind a stone wall; and
      there we saw 'em go by,&mdash;Earl Percy on his horse, and all his troops,
      ever so grand. He went on up to Concord. Fact is, if it hadn't been for
      him and his men, those regulars would all have been cut off: they wouldn't
      one of 'em have got back, for the whole country was up and fighting. The
      militia came pouring in from Weston and Acton and Billriky,&mdash;all the
      towns round. Then their Col. Smith was wounded, and a good many others,
      and lots of 'em killed, and our minute-men coming on 'em before and
      behind, and all around. But ye see, we couldn't stand regular troops and
      cannon; and so, when they come on, we had to give back. Earl Percy came
      up, and formed a hollow square, and they marched into it, and so gave 'em
      time to rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, there was need enough on't,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;The regulars had been
      hectored and picked, and driv 'round so from piller to post, that they was
      dog tired. Jimmy Irwin, he was a little chap then; but he telled me how he
      see the men jest threw 'emselves down on the ground, their tongues
      trailing out o' their mouths like hunting-dogs. You see, they had about
      two hundred wounded, and twenty eight or nine was taken prisoners, and
      sixty-four killed outright: so Lord Percy had his hands full o' takin'
      care o' the mess they'd got up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my grandfather, &ldquo;there were dead men lying all around the road
      as we came back. There, boys!&rdquo; he said, pointing to a gun and powder-horn
      over the chimney, &ldquo;we picked up these when we were coming home. We found
      them on a poor fellow who lay there dead in the road: there's some blood
      of his on it to this day. We couldn't help feeling it was most too bad
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow! he wa'n't to blame,&rdquo; said my grand-mother. &ldquo;Soldiers have to
      go as they're bid. War's an awful thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they shouldn't have begun it,&rdquo; interposed Aunt Lois. &ldquo;'They that
      take the sword shall perish by the sword.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, grandpapa,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what were the stores they went up to get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were stores laid up to enable us to go to war, and they were 'round
      in different places. There were two twenty-four-pounders that they spiked,
      and they threw about five hundred pounds of ball into the river or wells,
      and broke up sixty barrels of flour, and scattered it about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Sam triumphantly, &ldquo;there was one lot they didn't get. Cap'n
      Tim Wheeler had about the biggest lot o' wheat, and rye-flour, and
      corn-meal stored up in his barn, with some barrels of his own. So when
      this 'ere fine jay-bird of an officer came to him all so grand, and told
      him to open his barn and let him look in, the cap'n, he took his key, and
      walked right out, and opened the barndoor; and the officer was tickled to
      pieces. He thought he'd got such a haul!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If you please, sir,' says the cap'n, 'I'm a miller, and got my living by
      grinding grain. I'm a poor man. You can see my mill out there. I grind up
      a lot o' grain in the winter, and get it ready to sell in the spring.
      Some's wheat, and some's rye, and some's corn-meal; and this wheat is
      mine, and this rye is mine, and this corn-meal is mine;' and, when he
      spoke, he put his hand on his own barrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Oh! if this is your private property,' says the officer, 'we sha'n't
      touch that: we don't meddle with private property.' And so he turned on
      his heel, and the cap'n, he locked up his barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that telling the truth?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see it was true what he said,&rdquo; said Sam. &ldquo;Them bar'ls he laid
      his hands on was hisn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Aunt Lois told me yesterday it was as bad to act a lie as to speak
      one,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so I did,&rdquo; said Aunt Lois. &ldquo;The truth is the truth, and I 'll stick
      to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Aunt Lois, would you have told him, and let him break up all those
      barrels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shouldn't,&rdquo; said Aunt Lois. &ldquo;I should have done just as Cap'n Tim
      did; but I should have done <i>wrong</i>. Right is right, and wrong is
      wrong, even if I can't come up to it always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have done, grandfather?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      My grandfather's mild face slowly irradiated, as when moonbeams pass over
      a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't think I should have let him break up those
      barrels. If it was wrong to do as Cap'n Wheeler did, I think most likely I
      should 'a' done it. I don't suppose I'm any better than he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at any rate,&rdquo; said Aunt Lois, &ldquo;what folks' do in war time is no
      rule for ordinary times: every thing is upset then. There ain't any of the
      things they do in war time that are according to gospel teaching; but, if
      you boys were to do just as Cap'n Wheeler did, I should say you lied by
      speaking the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said my grandmother, &ldquo;those were dreadful times. Thank the
      Lord that they are past and gone, and we don't have such awful cases of
      conscience as we did then. I never could quite see how we did right to
      resist the king at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the Bible says, 'Resist the devil,'&rdquo; said Aunt Lois.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general laugh followed this sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always heard,&rdquo; said my grandfather, by way of changing the subject,
      &ldquo;that they meant to have taken Mr. Adams and Mr. Hancock and hung 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, to be sure they did,&rdquo; said Sam Lawson. &ldquo;I know all about that are.
      Sapphira Clark, up to Lexington, she told me all about that are, one day
      when I was to her house puttin' down her best parlor carpet. Sapphira
      wa'n't but ten or eleven years old when the war broke out; but she
      remembered all about it. Ye see, Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams was a-staying
      hid up at their house. Her father, Mr. Jonas Clark, was minister of
      Lexington; and he kep' 'em quite private, and didn't let nobody know they
      was there. Wal, Sapphira said they was all a-settin' at supper, when her
      father, he heard a great rapping at the front-door; and her father got up
      and went and opened it; and she looked after him into the entry, and could
      just see a man in a scarlet uniform standing at the door, and she heard
      him ask, 'Are Sam Adams and John Hancock here?' And her father answered,
      'Oh, hush! Don't mention those names here.'&mdash;'Then,' says the man, 'I
      come to tell you the British troops will be along by sunrise; and, if they
      are in your house, they'd better escape right away.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must have been Col. Paul Revere,&rdquo; said Aunt Lois. &ldquo;He went all
      through the country, from Boston to Concord, rousing up people, and
      telling 'em to be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did Mr. Adams and Hancock do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, they got ready right away, and slipped quietly out the back-door,
      and made their way over to Burlington, and staid in the minister's house
      over there out of the way of the battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would the British have done with 'em, if they had caught them?&rdquo; said
      I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hung 'em&mdash;high as Haman,&rdquo; said my Aunt Lois sententiously. &ldquo;That's
      what they'd have done. That's what they'd 'a' done to them, and to Gen.
      Washington, and lots more, if they'd had their way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said grandfather, &ldquo;they were mighty high-stepping at first.
      They thought they had only to come over and show themselves, and they
      could walk through the land, and hang and burn and slay just whom they'd a
      mind to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, they found 'twas like jumping into a hornets' nest,&rdquo; said Sam
      Lawson. &ldquo;They found that out at Lexington and Bunker Hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Con was in those trenches at Bunker Hill,&rdquo; said grandfather.
      &ldquo;There they dug away at the breastworks, with the bom'-shells firing round
      'em. They didn't mind them more than if they'd been hickory-nuts. They
      kep' fellows ready to pour water on 'em as they fell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never want to feel again as I did that day,&rdquo; said grandmother. &ldquo;I
      was in Boston, visiting cousin Jemima Russel, and we were all out on the
      roof of the house. The roofs everywhere were all alive with people looking
      through spy-glasses; and we could hear the firing, but couldn't tell how
      the day was going. And then they set Charlestown on fire; and the blaze
      and smoke and flame rose up, and there was such a snapping and crackling,
      and we could hear roofs and timbers falling, and see people running this
      way and that with their children&mdash;women scared half to death
      a-flying; and we knew all the time there was cousin Jane Wilkinson in that
      town sick in bed, with a baby only a few days old. It's a wonder how Jane
      ever lived through it; but they did get her through alive, and her baby
      too. That burning Charlestown settled to fight it through: it was so mean
      and cruel needless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my grandfather, &ldquo;that day settled the question that we would
      be free and independent, or die; and, though our men had to retreat, yet
      it was as good as a defeat to the British. They lost ten hundred and
      fifty-four in point with a good many. They determined then killed and
      wounded, and we only four hundred and fifty-three; and our men learned
      that they could fight as well as the British. Congress went right to work
      to raise an army, and appointed Gen. Washington commander. Your gran'ther
      Stowe, boys, was orderly of the day when Gen. Washington took the command
      at Cambridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I was in Cambridge that day and saw it all. Ye see, the
      army was drawn up under the big elm there; and Ike Newel and I, we clim up
      into a tree, and got a place where we could look down and see. I wa'n't
      but ten year old then; but, if ever a mortal man looked like the angel of
      the Lord, the gineral looked like it that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some said that there was trouble about having Gen. Ward give up the
      command to a Southern man,&rdquo; said my grandfather. &ldquo;Gen. Ward was a brave
      man and very popular; but everybody was satisfied when they came to know
      Gen. Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There couldn't no minister have seemed more godly than he did that day,&rdquo;
       said Sam. &ldquo;He read out of the hymn-book the hundred and first Psalm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that psalm?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws, boys! I know it by heart,&rdquo; said Sam, &ldquo;I was so impressed hearin' on
      him read it. I can say it to you:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      '&ldquo;Mercy and judgment are my song,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And since they both to thee belong,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      My gracious God, my righteous King,

      To thee my songs and vows I bring.

      Where I have power, shall be suppressed.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he did it too,&rdquo; remarked Aunt Lois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He trusted in the Lord, and the Lord brought him to honor,&rdquo; said my
      grandmother. &ldquo;When he took the army, every thing was agin' us: it didn't
      seem possible we should succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, he was awful put to it sometimes,&rdquo; said Sam Lawson. &ldquo;I 'member Uncle
      David Morse was a-tellin' me 'bout that are time down in New York when
      the' Massachusetts and Connecticut boys all broke and run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Massachusetts boys run? How came that Sam?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, you see, sometimes fellows will get a-runnin'; and it jest goes from
      one to another like fire, and ye can't stop it. It was after the battle of
      Long Island, when our men had been fighting day after day, and had to
      retreat. A good many were wounded, and a good many of 'em were sick and
      half-sick; and they'd got sort o' tired and discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lord Howe and the British came to make a landing at Kipp's Bay
      round by New York; and the troops set to guard the landing began to run,
      and the Massachusetts and Connecticut men were sent to help 'em. Uncle
      David says that the fellows that run spread the panic among 'em; and they
      looked ahead, and saw an ox-drag on top of a hill they was to pass, and
      they thought 'twas a cannon pintin' right at 'em; and the boys, they jest
      broke and run,&mdash;cut right across the road, and cleared over the
      fence, and streaked it off cross-lots and up hill like a flock o' sheep.
      Uncle David, he run too; but he'd been sick o' dysentary, and was so weak
      he couldn't climb the fence: so he stopped and looked back, and saw
      Gineral Washington cantering up behind 'em, shouting, and waving his
      sword, looking like a flamin' fire. Oh, he was thunderin' mad, the gineral
      was! And, when he see the fellows skittering off cross-lots, he jest
      slammed his hat down on the ground, and give up. 'Great heavens!' says he,
      'are these the men I've got to fight this battle with?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Uncle David, he picked up the gineral's hat, and come up and made
      his bow, and said, 'Gineral, here's your hat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Thank you, sir!' said the gineral. 'I'm glad to see one brave fellow
      that can stand his ground. <i>You</i> didn't run.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle David said he felt pretty cheap, 'cause he know'd in his own heart
      that he would 'a' run, only he was too weak to git over the fence; but he
      didn't tell the gineral that, I bet He put the compliment in his pocket,
      and said nothing; for now the gineral's aides came riding up full drive,
      and told him they must be off out of the field in a minute, or the British
      would have 'em, and so one on 'em took Uncle David up behind him, and away
      they cantered. It was a pretty close shave too: the British was only a few
      rods behind 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, if they had caught him!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Only think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they would have hung him; but we should have had another in his
      place,&rdquo; said Aunt Lois. &ldquo;The war wouldn't 'a' stopped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, 'twas to be as 'twas,&rdquo; said my grandmother. &ldquo;The Lord had respect
      to the prayers of our fathers, and he'd decreed that America should be
      free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sam: &ldquo;Parson Badger said in one o' his sermons, that men
      always was safe when they was goin' in the line o' God's decrees: I guess
      that are was about it. But, massy! is that are the nine o'clock bell? I
      must make haste home, or I dun' know what Hetty 'll say to me.&rdquo;

      MONG the pleasantest of my recollections of old Bowdoin is the salt-air
      flavor of its sea experiences. The site of Brunswick is a sandy plain, on
      which the college buildings seem to have been dropped for the good old
      Yankee economic reason of using land for public buildings that could not
      be used for any thing else. The soil was a fathomless depth of dry, sharp,
      barren sand, out of whose bosom nothing but pitch-pines and
      blueberry-bushes emerged, or ever could emerge without superhuman efforts
      of cultivation. But these sandy plains, these pine forests, were neighbors
      to the great, lively, musical blue ocean, whose life-giving presence made
      itself seen, heard, and felt every hour of the day and night. The
      beautiful peculiarity of the Maine coast, where the sea interpenetrates
      the land in picturesque fiords and lakes, brought a constant romantic
      element into the landscape. White-winged ships from India or China came
      gliding into the forest recesses bringing news from strange lands, and
      tidings of wild adventure, into secluded farmhouses, that, for the most
      part, seemed to be dreaming in woodland solitude. In the early days of my
      college life the shipping interest of Maine gave it an outlook into all
      the countries of the earth. Ships and ship-building and ship-launching
      were the drift of the popular thought; and the very minds of the people by
      this commerce had apparently

    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;Suffered a sea change
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Into something rare and strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a quaintness, shrewdness, and vivacity of lonely solitude about
      these men, (half skipper, half farmer!) that half skip was piquant and
      enlivening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the auspicious period of approaching Thanksgiving that my chum
      and I resolved to antedate for a few days our vacation, and take passage
      on the little sloop &ldquo;Brilliant,&rdquo; that lay courtesying and teetering on the
      bright waters of Maquoit Bay, loading up to make her Thanksgiving trip to
      Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright Indian-summer afternoon that saw us all on board the
      little craft. She was laden deep with dainties and rarities for the festal
      appetites of Boston nabobs,&mdash;loads of those mealy potatoes for which
      the fields of Maine were justly famed, barrels of ruby cranberries, boxes
      of solid golden butter (ventures of a thrifty housemother emulous to
      gather kindred gold in the Boston market). Then there were dressed
      chickens, turkeys, and geese, all going the same way, on the same errand;
      and there were sides and saddles of that choice mutton for which the sea
      islands of Maine were as famous as the South Downs of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing in such a stowage was suggestive of good cheer. The little
      craft itself had a sociable, friendly, domestic air. The captain and mate
      were cousins: the men were all neighbors, sons of families who had grown
      up together. There was a kindly home flavor in the very stowage of the
      cargo. Here were Melissa's cranberries, and by many a joke and wink we
      were apprised that the mate had a tender interest in that venture. There
      was Widder Toothacre's butter, concerning which there were various
      comments and speculations, but which was handled and cared for with the
      consideration the Maine sailor-boy always gives to &ldquo;the widder.&rdquo; There was
      a private keg of very choice eggs, over which the name of Lucindy Ann was
      breathed by a bright-eyed, lively youngster, who had promised to bring her
      back the change, and as to the precise particulars of this change many a
      witticism was expended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mode of living on the &ldquo;Brilliant&rdquo; was of the simplest and most
      primitive kind. On each side the staircase that led down to the cabin,
      hooped strongly to the partition, was a barrel, which on the one side
      contained salt beef, and on the other salt pork. A piece out of each
      barrel, delivered regularly to the cook, formed the foundation of our
      daily meals; and sea-biscuit and potatoes, with the sauce of salt-water
      appetites, made this a feast for a king. I make no mention here of
      gingerbread and doughnuts, and such like ornamental accessories, which
      were not wanting, nor of nuts and sweet cider, which were to be had for
      the asking. At meal-times a swing-shelf, which at other seasons hung flat
      against the wall, was propped up, and our meals were eaten thereon in
      joyous satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      A joyous, rollicking set we were, and the whole expedition was a frolic of
      the first water. One of the drollest features of these little impromptu
      voyages often was the woe-begone aspect of some unsuspecting land-lubber,
      who had been beguiled into thinking that he would like a trip to Boston by
      seeing the pretty &ldquo;Brilliant&rdquo; courtesying in the smooth waters of Maquoit,
      and so had embarked, in innocent ignorance of the physiological resets of
      such enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember the first morning out. As we were driving ahead, under a stiff
      breeze, I came on deck, and found the respectable Deacon Muggins, who in
      his Sunday coat had serenely embarked the day before, now desolately
      clinging to the railing, very white about the gills, and contemplating the
      sea with a most suggestive expression of disgust and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, deacon, good-morning! How are you? Splendid morning!&rdquo; said I
      maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a deep breath, surveyed me with a mixture of indignation and
      despair, and then gave vent to his feelings: &ldquo;Tell ye what: there was one
      darned old fool up to Brunswick yesterday! but he ain't there now: he's <i>here</i>.&rdquo;
       The deacon, in the weekly prayer-meeting at Brunswick, used to talk of the
      necessity of being &ldquo;emptied of self:&rdquo; he seemed to be in the way of it in
      the most literal manner at the present moment. In a few minutes he was
      extended on the deck, the most utterly limp and dejected of deacons, and
      vowing with energy, if he ever got out o' this 'ere, you wouldn't catch
      him again. Of course, my chum and I were not seasick. We were prosperous
      young sophomores in Bowdoin College, and would have scorned to acknowledge
      such a weakness. In fact, we were in that happy state of self-opinion
      where we surveyed every thing in creation, as birds do, from above, and
      were disposed to patronize everybody we met, with a pleasing conviction
      that there was nothing worth knowing, but what we were likely to know, or
      worth doing, but what we could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Capt. Stanwood liked us, and we liked him: we patronized him, and he was
      quietly amused at our patronage, and returned it in kind. He was a good
      specimen of the sea-captain in those early days in Maine: a man in middle
      life, tall, thin, wiry, and active, full of resource and shrewd
      mother-wit; a man very confident in his opinions, because his knowledge
      was all got at first-hand,&mdash;the result of a careful use of his own
      five senses. From his childhood he had followed the seas, and, as he grew
      older, made voyages to Archangel, to Messina, to the West Indies, and
      finally round the Horn; and, having carried a very sharp and careful pair
      of eyes, he had acquired not only a snug competency of worldly goods, but
      a large stock of facts and inductions, which stood him in stead of an
      education. He was master of a thriving farm at Harpswell, and, being
      tethered somewhat by love of wife and children, was mostly stationary
      there, yet solaced himself by running a little schooner to Boston, and
      driving a thriving bit of trade by the means. With that reverence for
      learning' which never deserts the New-Englander, he liked us the better
      for being collegians, and amiably conceded that there were things quite
      worth knowing taught &ldquo;up to Brunswick there,&rdquo; though he delighted now and
      then to show his superiority in talking about what he knew better than we.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Larned, the mate, was a lusty youngster, a sister's son whom he had
      taken in training in the way he should go. Jim had already made a voyage
      to Liverpool and the East Indies, and felt himself also quite an authority
      in his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evenings were raw and cool; and we generally gathered round the cabin
      stove, cracking walnuts, smoking, and telling stories, and having a jolly
      time generally. It is but due to those old days to say that a most
      respectable Puritan flavor penetrated even the recesses of those coasters,&mdash;a
      sort of gentle Bible and psalm-book aroma, so that there was not a word or
      a joke among the men to annoy the susceptibilities even of a deacon. Our
      deacon, somewhat consoled and amended, lay serene in his berth, rather
      enjoying the yarns that we were spinning. The web, of course, was
      many-colored,&mdash;of quaint and strange and wonderful; and, as the night
      wore on, it was dyed in certain weird tints of the supernatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jim Larned, &ldquo;folks may say what they're a mind to: there are
      things that there's no sort o' way o' 'countin' for,&mdash;things you've
      jist got to say. Well, here's suthin' to work that I don't know nothin'
      about; and, come to question any man up sharp, you 'll find he's seen <i>one</i>
      thing o' that sort' himself; and this 'ere I'm going to tell's <i>my</i>
      story:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four years ago I went down to aunt Jerushy's at Fair Haven. Her husband's
      in the oysterin' business, and I used to go out with him considerable.
      Well, there was Bill Jones there,&mdash;a real bright fellow, one of your
      open-handed, lively fellows,&mdash;and he took a fancy to me, and I to
      him, and he and I struck up a friendship. He run an oyster-smack to New
      York, and did a considerable good business for a young man. Well, Bill had
      a fellow on his smack that I never looks of. He was from the Malays, or
      foreign crittur, or other; spoke broken English; had eyes set kind o'
      edgeways 'n his head: homely as sin he was, and I always mistrusted him.
      'Bill,' I used to say, 'you look out for that fellow: don't you trust him.
      If I was you, I'd ship him off short metre.' But Bill, he only laughed.
      'Why,' says he, 'I can get double work for the same pay out o' that
      fellow; and what do I care if he ain't handsome?' I remember how chipper
      an' cheery Bill looked when he was sayin' that, just as he was going down
      to New York with his load o' oysters. Well, the next night I was sound
      asleep in aunt Jerusha's front-chamber that opens towards the Sound, and I
      was waked right clear out o' sleep by Bill's voice screaming to me. I got
      up and run to the window, and looked liked the some out, and I heard it
      again, plain as any thing: 'Jim, Jim! Help, help!' It wasn't a common cry,
      neither: it was screeched out, as if somebody was murdering him. I tell
      you, it rung through my head for weeks afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what came of it?&rdquo; said my chum, as the narrator made a pause, and
      we all looked at him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as nigh as we can make it out, that very night poor Bill <i>was</i>
      murdered by that very Malay feller: leastways, his body was found in his
      boat. He'd been stabbed, and all his money and watch and things taken, and
      this Malay was gone nobody knew where. That's all that was ever known
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said my chum, who was of a very literal and rationalistic
      turn of mind, &ldquo;it couldn't have been his voice you heard: he must have
      been down to the other end of the Sound, close by New York, by that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the mate, &ldquo;all I know is, that I was waked out of sleep by
      Bill's voice calling my name, screaming in a real agony. It went through
      me like lightning; and then I find he was murdered that night. Now, I
      don't know any thing about it. I know I heard him calling me; I know he
      was murdered: but <i>how</i> it was, or <i>what</i> it was, or <i>why</i>
      it was, I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These 'ere college boys can tell ye,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Of course,
      they've got into sophomore year, and there ain't nothing in heaven or
      earth that they don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I say with Hamlet, 'There are more things in heaven and
      earth, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said my chum, with the air of a philosopher, &ldquo;what shakes my faith
      in all supernatural stories is, that I can't see any use or purpose in
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, if there couldn't nothin' happen nor be except what <i>you</i> could
      see a use in, there wouldn't <i>much</i> happen nor be,&rdquo; quoth the
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A laugh went round at the expense of my friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, I 'll tell ye what, boys,&rdquo; piped the thin voice of the deacon,
      &ldquo;folks mustn't be too presumptuous: there is providences permitted that we
      don't see no use in; but they do happen,&mdash;yes, they do. Now, what Jim
      Larned's been a-tell-in' is a good deal like what happened to me once,
      when I was up to Umbagog, in the lumberin' business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; called out Jim, &ldquo;here's the deacon's story! I told you every man
      had one.&mdash;Give it to us, deacon! Speak out, and don't be bashful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, really, it ain't what I like to talk about,&rdquo; said the deacon, in a
      quavering, uncertain voice; &ldquo;but I don't know but I may as well, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was that winter I was up to Umbagog. I was clerk, and kep' the 'counts
      and books, and all that; and Tom Huly,&mdash;he was surveyor and marker,&mdash;he
      was there with me, and we chummed together. And there was Jack Cutter; he
      was jest out o' college: he was there practising surveyin' with him. We
      three had a kind o' pine-board sort o' shanty, built out on a plain near
      by the camp: it had a fire-place, and two windows, and our bunks, and each
      of us had our tables and books and things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Huly, he started with a party of three or four to go up through the
      woods to look out a new tract. It was two or three days' journey through
      the woods; and jest about that time the Indians up there was getting sort
      o' uneasy, and we all thought mabbe 'twas sort o' risky: howsomdever, Tom
      had gone off in high spirits, and told us to be sure and take care of his
      books and papers. Tom had a lot of books, and thought every thing of 'em,
      and was sort o' particular and nice about his papers. His table sot up one
      side, by the winder, where he could see to read and write. Well, he'd been
      gone four days, when one night&mdash;it was a bright 'moonlight night&mdash;Jack
      and I were sitting by the fire, reading, and between nine and ten o'clock
      there came a strong, regular knock on the window over by Tom's table. We
      were sitting with our backs to the window. 'Halloo!' says Jack, 'who's
      that?' We both jumped up, and went to the window and looked out, and see
      there warn't nobody there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'This is curus,' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Some of the boys trying to trick us,' says he. 'Let's keep watch:
      perhaps they 'll do it again,' says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sot down by the fire, and 'fore long it came again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Jack and I both cut out the door, and run round the house,&mdash;he
      one way, and I the other. It was light as day, and nothin' for anybody to
      hide behind, and there warn't a critter in sight. Well, we come in and sot
      down, and looked at each other kind o' puzzled, when it come agin,
      harder'n ever; and Jack looked to the window, and got as white as a sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'For the Lord's sake, do look!' says he. And you may believe me or not;
      but I tell you it's a solemn fact: Tom's books was movin',&mdash;jest as
      if somebody was pickin' 'em up, and putting 'em down again, jest as I've
      seen him do a hundred times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Jack,' says I, 'something's happened to Tom.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, there had. That very night Tom was murdered by the Indians. We put
      down the date, and a week arter the news came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, captain,&rdquo; said I, breaking the pause that followed the deacon's
      story, &ldquo;give us your story. You've been all over the world, in all times
      and all weathers, and you ain't a man to be taken in. Did you ever see any
      thing of this sort?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, boys, since you put it straight at me, I don't care if I say I
      have,&mdash;on these 'ere very waters we're a-sailin' over now, on board
      this very schooner, in this very cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was bringing matters close home. We felt an agreeable shiver, and
      looked over our shoulders: the deacon, in his berth, raised up on his
      elbow, and ejaculated, &ldquo;Dew tell! ye don't say so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about it, captain,&rdquo; we both insisted. &ldquo;We 'll take your word for
      most any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it happened about five years ago. It's goin' on now eight years ago
      that my father died. He sailed out of Gloucester: had his house there;
      and, after he died, mother, she jest kep' on in the old place. I went down
      at first to see her fixed up about right, and after that I went now and
      then, and now and then I sent money. Well, it was about Thanksgiving time,
      as it is now, and I'd ben down to Boston, and was coming back pretty well
      loaded with the things I'd been buying in Boston for Thanksgiving at home,&mdash;raisins
      and sugar, and all sorts of West Ingy goods, for the folks in Harpswell.
      Well, I meant to have gone down to Gloucester to see mother; but I had so
      many ways to run, and so much to do, I was afraid I wouldn't be back on
      time; and so I didn't see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we was driving back with a good stiff breeze, and we'd got past
      Cape Ann, and I'd gone down and turned in, and was fast asleep in my
      berth. It was past midnight: every one on the schooner asleep, except the
      mate, who was up on the watch. I was sleepin' as sound as ever I slept in
      my life,&mdash;not a dream, nor a feelin', no more'n if I had been dead,&mdash;when
      suddenly I waked square up. My eyes flew open like a spring, with my mind
      clear and wide awake, and, sure as I ever see any thing, I see my father
      standing right in the middle of the cabin, looking right at me. I rose
      right up in my berth, and says I,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Father, is that you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' says he, 'it is me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Father,' says I, 'what do you come for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sam,' says he, 'do you go right back to Gloucester, and take your mother
      home with you, and keep her there as long as she lives.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And says I, 'Father, I will.' And as I said this he faded out and was
      gone. I got right up, and run up on deck, and called out, ''Bout ship!'
      Mr. More&mdash;he was my mate then&mdash;stared at me as if he didn't
      believe his ears. ''Bout ship!' says I. 'I'm going to Gloucester.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he put the ship about, and then came to me, and says, 'What the
      devil does this mean? We're way past Cape Ann. It's forty miles right back
      to Gloucester.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Can't help it,' I said. 'To Gloucester I must go as quick as wind and
      water will carry me. I've thought of matters there that I <i>must</i>
      attend to, no matter what happens.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ben More and I were good friends always; but I tell you all that
      day he watched me, in a curious kind of way, to see if I weren't took with
      a fever, or suthin; and the men, they whispered and talked among
      themselves. You see, they all had their own reasons for wanting to be back
      to Thanksgiving, and it was hard on 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was just about sun up we got into Gloucester, and I went ashore.
      And there was mother, looking pretty poorly, jest making her fire, and
      getting on her kettle. When she saw me, she held up her hands, and burst
      out crying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, Sam, the Lord must 'a' sent you! I've time, and I've felt as if I
      couldn't hold our much longer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' says I, 'mother, pack up your things, and come right aboard the
      sloop; for I've come to take you home, and take care of you: so put up
      your things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I took hold and helped her, and we put ben sick and all alone,
      having a drefful hard things together lively, and packed up her trunks,
      and tied up the bed and pillows and bedclothes, and took her rocking-chair
      and bureau and tables and chairs down to the sloop. And when I came down,
      bringing her and all her things, Ben More seemed to see what I was after;
      but how or why the idea came into my head I never told him. There's things
      that a man feels shy of tellin',' and I didn't want to talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when we was all aboard, the wind sprung up fair and steady, and we
      went on at a right spanking pace; and the fellows said the Harpswell girls
      had got hold of our rope, and was pulling us with all their might; and we
      came in all right the very day before Thanksgiving. And my wife was as
      glad to see mother as if she'd expected her, and fixed up the
      front-chamber for her, with a stove in't, and plenty of kindlings. And the
      children was all so glad to see grandma, and we had the best kind of a
      Thanksgiving!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;nobody could say there wasn't any use in <i>that</i>
      spirit's coming (if spirit it was): it had a most practical purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I've been all round the world, in all sorts of
      countries, seen all sorts of queer, strange things, and seen so many
      things that I never could have believed if I hadn't seen 'em, that I never
      say I won't believe this or that. If I see a thing right straight under my
      eyes, I don't say it couldn't 'a' ben there 'cause college-folks say there
      ain't no such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it wasn't all a dream?&rdquo; said my chum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know?' Cause I was broad awake, and I gen 'lly know when I'm
      awake and when I'm asleep. I think Mr. More found me pretty wide awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now time to turn in, and we slept soundly while the &ldquo;Brilliant&rdquo;
       ploughed her way. By daybreak the dome of the State House was in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've settled the captain's story,&rdquo; said my chum to me. &ldquo;It can all be
      accounted for on the theory of cerebral hallucination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but it answered the purpose beautifully for the old
      mother.&rdquo;
